11,"The headphones i got were either defective or fake apple head phones. I got 2 sets of head phones. One pair has a defective mic. The mic did not work. The volume buttons worked, but the mic didn't. On that same pair, the sound is bad quality. I listened to music I made, and heard that instruments i panned to the right were playing out of the left headphone, and instruments i had panned to the left were playing out of the right. I played one of my songs and compared that pair of headphones to my step-mom's headphones (the ones that came with her iPhone 5) and heard a significant difference. I had her listen to the same song out of both headphones and she too heard the difference. The headphones that came with her phone bangs harder and cleaner. The second pair that i ordered seems a little better. The panning is correct unlike the first pair (instruments panned to the right played out of the right headphone and instruments panned to the left played out of the left headphone.) But still, the headphones that came with my step-mom's iPhone 5 sounded cleaner. Another problem i noticed was that these headphones looked just a little different. Hard to tell, but a closer look shows the difference. These were a different white compared the the iPhone 5 headphones. The box that it came in had the apple logo, and it says ""designed by apple in California assembled in China"" on the headphones just like the one that came with the iPhone 5, so I'm not sure if these are just defective or fake. For the price i payed i shouldn't be complaining, but i ordered apple earpods, i just want what i ordered.",1.0,0,headphones got either defective fake apple head phones got sets head phones one pair defective mic mic work volume buttons worked mic didnt pair sound bad quality listened music made heard instruments panned right playing left headphone instruments panned left playing right played one songs compared pair headphones stepmoms headphones ones came iphone heard significant difference listen song headphones heard difference headphones came phone bangs harder cleaner second pair ordered seems little better panning correct unlike first pair instruments panned right played right headphone instruments panned left played left headphone still headphones came stepmoms iphone sounded cleaner another problem noticed headphones looked little different hard tell closer look shows difference different white compared iphone headphones box came apple logo says designed apple california assembled china headphones like one came iphone im sure defective fake price payed shouldnt complaining ordered apple earpods want ordered

15,"I received mine today and it came nicely in the standard Apple packaging (jewel box inside a sealed white box) with all documentations enclosed. The left & right pods snaps snugly fit in the crate (fakes would be dangling loose), all the gray plastic band around the white wires are cut evenly (fakes are uneven), the grilles on both pods are 'micro mesh' metal -- unlike cloths on the fakes. The pods also have an even smooth texture whereas the fakes are rough. You'll know it when you feel it in your hands. This is the second Apple product I bought DIRECTLY through Amazon instead of from third-party sellers. The first was anAirport Extreme 802.11N (5TH GEN) router, but then again, like everything else, I only buy when it says 'Ships from and sold by Amazon.com'. Rest assured that you WILL get the real deal when you click that link button.Now let's get to the product...This is a huge improvement over the regular Apple earbuds that came with my 4th Gen iPod, the design is much better and it is extremely comfortable to wear. It stays locked in comfortably in my ears but I can barely feel them because of the contoured design. The sound is excellent; you get enough lows (bass) and highs (trebles) and it is well-balanced with the mids, but above all, sound reproduction was crystal-clear to the least.The +/- controller/mic button (and where the hell did they hid that mic???) worked well with my iPod, it controls the volume like it should and pauses/play when pressing the center part. I'm sure it does more but I haven't have time for that since I bought these pods for the purpose of using it as a hands-free device along with one of my cell phone while driving.Android phones compatibility (non-Apple iPhones)...Since most phones have ditched and gone away with their proprietary plugs (thanks to Apple) and seemed to embraced the old retro 3.5mm headphone/mic jacks, at least all three of my new smartphones came with it and I was hoping for the best. Here are the results:1.) ---LG Optimus L9---The mic did NOT work! It is dead silent during a call, or creates a high pitch feedback noise when using the voice recorder function. The pods can only be used for listening to audio as a headphone set. It also disables the mic from the cellphone unless you put it on speaker, but that defeats the purpose.2.) ---T-Mobile Mytouch 4G Huawei U8680---Also did not work similar to the LG and only can be used as a standard audio headphone/earbud.3.) ---Samsung Galaxy S Blaze 4G---This WORKED!!! The mic functions as hands-free unit where the other party can hear clearly. During the test, the mic from the cellphone seemed to work in unison with the pod where it can create a slight echo effect if the two are held too close to each other, but should be fine when making real-time calls distanced away from each other. The +/- functions from the controller did not work (as expected) but pushing the center part would 'end' a call.Now some of you might be asking why would I spend the money and gamble on something like this that might or might not work. I have three reasons:1. I've read many reviews and some people had commented that the mic on these Apple pods produces clearer more 'audible' sound compared to other headsets, also, some say that it works with certain Samsung Galaxy phones....and no doubt it did!2. I can't have earbuds with the silicon plastic tips since my g/f will be pulling them in and out of the center console, if they fall off, it renders the headset useless.3. They are not noise-canceling where it is crucial when used during driving.I'm really glad that it worked out because I purchased these pods for the sole intention of using it along with the Samsung.

17,"I bought these headphones to use while walking to and from classes; they are light weight and stay in your ears extremely well. I was definitely debating at first whether it would be worth buying the earpods rather then just buying the original iPod headphones, however; once I received, and had tried, the new earpods that I ordered, I had absolutely no regrets on buying them over the older style. Amazing sound quality; bass is excellent; the mic and volume controls on the cord work so good with my iPod video.  Although I was disappointed when the volume buttons were not compatible with my Droid Razr Maxx, the pause and play button still worked fairly well. I have not tried answering calls with the mic yet but I plan on trying soon.These earpods get a solid 5 stars from me. Great buy.",5.0,1,bought headphones use walking classes light weight stay ears extremely well definitely debating first whether would worth buying earpods rather buying original ipod headphones however received tried new earpods ordered absolutely regrets buying older style amazing sound quality bass excellent mic volume controls cord work good ipod video although disappointed volume buttons compatible droid razr maxx pause play button still worked fairly well tried answering calls mic yet plan trying soonthese earpods get solid stars great buy

I'm hoping it was just the one pair and plan to buy again because I really liked the sound and feel of them. The microphone works great too. It may be the case that I stored it in that came with it. Maybe it caused there to be too much tension on it.

Sound is much clearer, louder, cleaner, and overall, better. They look and fit unusual for me for the first few minutes, but then they became one of the most comfortable earbuds I have used. They have not fallen out yet (not that I had a problem with the older buds). Since these are more bulky than the older buds, they come with a nice, compact traveling case.The remote and mic is extremely convenient for answering a call or changing your music quickly.Pros:Cleaner SoundMuch better bassFits more comfortablyTraveling case is a nice touchNo noise isolation (my opinion, I don't like the pressure)Cons:Price is still a bit highAt high volumes, some sounds are distortedThis is not an issue yet, but as cheaper knock offs appear, many people will be tempted by them.Buy from Amazon with Amazon.com as the seller.

Sure, the original Apple earphones used to fall out a lot, but that was the only thing. These earphones are supposed to be more comfortable than their predecessor.

96,"1 Star for being Comfy.1 Star for good design and cool case (and still good sound).Bass is absurd with this. I think Apple went overboard with these and their bass response. It honestly overwhelms the rest of the music (Mids and High freqs are still audible, but very much so superseded by bass) When I used the 'Bass Reducer' Music app option for the EQ settings on my iPhone, it sounds fine. Problem is though I don't exactly have that setting everywhere, especially as everyday headphones for any computer, or other device. I would rather hear the actual sound of the music, without added bass thank you!Indeed, it's pretty amazing to hear the bass emulated like it does, because it sounds very real. So buy these if you are looking for a massive amount of bass amplification.But.. if you like the sound of the old EarBuds, then pass on these, unless you are curious (like I was). Had no idea it would warp the music like it does though. Practically any sound now has bass with these.I will stick with the other Apple EarBuds, which are still superior, and some of the best sounding headphones I have ever experienced (without paying 200+).I very well may use these while running since they are comfy, but I don't like that my battery will now go down faster due to using an EQ.Hope this review helps some make informed decisions.",2.0,0,star star good design cool case still good soundbass absurd think apple went overboard bass response honestly overwhelms rest music mids high freqs still audible much superseded bass used bass reducer music app option eq settings iphone sounds fine problem though dont exactly setting everywhere especially everyday headphones computer device would rather hear actual sound music without added bass thank youindeed pretty amazing hear bass emulated like sounds real buy looking massive amount bass amplificationbut like sound old earbuds pass unless curious like idea would warp music like though practically sound bass thesei stick apple earbuds still superior best sounding headphones ever experienced without paying well may use running since comfy dont like battery go faster due using eqhope review helps make informed decisions

Tried the UE and I would say that they really live upto their name:Ultimate! But spending 226$ on them after having had spent 140+ on ATH didnt seem to make my pocket comfortabel enough.Read lot of reviews and was almost crazy about getting Klipsch S4i, but the extra cost as compared to this and the customer images showing sparse build quality put me off, literally.And now, I have got one of the most value for money gadgets for my ears. They sound more than satisfactory for my needs. Mind it, My ears have been obsessed with the sounds out of an ATH M50 since 14 months now and they are not complaining.The Bass has really gone up! The headphones from Apple have always been good in terms of crispness and they retain that.Best part is that they are far more comfortable to wear although you cannot wear them across the ear as other headphones(coil round across the ear).

129,"I am a trained musician and spend 8 hours a day on the phone in meetings.  I have used everything from studio gear to free junk they give away at health clubs.  These headphones hit the mark exactly!  I am so happy with them I can't tell you.  Are they perfect?  Of course not... there are plenty of huge headphones weighing pounds and giving you neck strain if you want perfect.  My lastest model Bose noise canceling are what I use for good sound isolation in cars and planes for example.  What I wanted from the Apple Earpods was decent sound in a lightweight comfortable earphone that didn't jam into my ear canal stuffing the wax in and giving me a headache.  I hate the fade-crazed in-ear earphones that are pretty much ear-corks.  Those of you that want to blindly follow the crowd, stop reading and go get something more generic.  For me, it's really hard finding decent earphones with a microphone that hangs comfortably in your external ear.  The original Apple earbuds never lasted.  The rubber wore out and wearing them running typically ended up breaking the flimsy wires.  I must have 6 pairs of unfortunate apple earbuds at home.  I've even tried the repairs you see on YouTube... no luck.  Did I mention that I need a pair of earphones I can wear all day and then for workouts?  No Corks!I liked the sound of the new Apple Earpods immediately.  But when I got to work, I compared them to my Seinnheiser HD 800s. I was shocked.  Of course the pro-quality Seinnheiser's had advantages.  Some of the reviewers point out details here and there of things they could find wrong. But my experience was that under normal music listening, the Apple Earpods held up really well.  Then I gave them the ultimate test.  My dub-step listening daughter tried them.  She squealed and asked if I'd buy her a pair.  She said they make her Skull candy sound like ****.  That is definitely a recommendation for base response.I've used them for hours of meetings already and everyone says they sound great.In short, the Apple Earpods are exactly what I wanted.  More robust, better sound (especially base) in an earphone that fits comfortably in your outer ear for all day wear.

131,"I bought the ""Apple Earpods with Remote and Mic"" 3-4 ago and have been using them everyday with either my iPhone or iPod for 2-3 weeks now.Sound quality: They are very good (perhaps even better than my last iPod headphones). With music, the base is crystal clear (rap music sounds awesome on this), the melody comes through cleanly (Classical piano or any other classical music makes you feel as if you are in the theater) and the volume can be made loud enough to block out the outside world. And, I can easily switch the music with the remote and have not had the experience of the remote suddenly switching/stopping my music during my walk-workout or at work.With the phone, the speaker comes through clearly and I can increase/lower the volume easily during the call as needed.Style: As with most Apple products, the earpods look cool. Each earpod is designed to fit either the left/right ear, and are not comfortable (or sound very loud) when an earpod is placed in the wrong ear (i.e. right earpod for right ear, e.t.c.). I have worn them for 1-2 hours for workout (usually brisk walking) or 3-4 hours for work, and the earpods do not feel uncomfortable after that time( I have also not had the experience of the earpods falling out during my walks )Remote: The remote works well, and is far enough down the wire that I do not come in contact with it during the use of the phone.Overall, I like the earpods and enjoy using them for either my iPod or iPhone.

I've also tried brands like Skullcandy in several models, and other models that came with phones and or CD players. The results were all the same. No matter which size cushions I picked on them, they were still too large for my ears. They were always falling out, and I always ended up losing the little foam/plastic cushions.I got these with my iPhone 5, and I loved them immediately. I can run in these and they don't fall out. The container they come with to store them is very well thought out too. I was really sad when I lost my first pair.

While the sound produced by these earbuds is fine, so is the sound produced by ones costing half as much. However, the fit in the ear is where these earphones are third rate at best. Unlike many other products, there is no accommodation for various ear sizes. I find that they sit very loosely and I am constantly fiddling with them to keep them seated. If you listen to music sitting absolutely still, they may be ok. Using them while running is impossible I would say. I have used them in the gym but not without constantly reseating them.

170,"These earphones are the best earphones that Apple has made thus far. As far as I've seen, they are extremely durable; the pair that came with my iPhone 5 survived being both washed and dried, and the pair that I bought from Amazon survived being sucked up by a vacuum cleaner. I also think its worth mentioning that I use these in the shower a lot (albeit I don't get them actually wet, I keep my head dry as I use my phone in its waterproof case, the significance of this being that they frequently survive The 100% humidity.)The sound is also much better than the sound from Apple's old earphones. The sound stays constant across the board, although I cannot speak for how they sound at +75% volume because I never listen to it that high. They seem to hit sounds very accurately across the board, until you reach the very low lows and the very high highs. However, they still manage to hit many lows and many highs, and anyone who isn't too discerning in their musical taste will be more than happy with these.They also fit very well. I can listen to music for hours without any discomfort. It's as if they aren't even in my ears; sometimes, if I'm listening to a song that I haven't heard before and there's something odd in it like the sound of an airplane going by or someone calling you, I have to pop one or even both out to be sure that the sound isn't real. That is very impressive. Furthermore, if you drop your phone as you're listening, the pressure seems to be very equally displaced across the ear, making the drop much less painful that with the old Apple earbuds.Additionally, the audio jack itself seems to be much more durable. This part tends to be a major failing of earbuds since, when you drop your phone or accidentally pull away from your laptop in a rolling chair, all of the pressure from that action is focused on the jack. However, this part has held up extremely well. Impressive.The reason I haven't given this product five stars is simply because of its price. I'm not quite sure whether there buying another pair of earbuds would be better value for the money. Furthermore, regardless of whether or not you could buy a pair with better value, I'm sure that Apple could have priced these lower. These were undoubtedly made in a factory in China for 50 cents. Perhaps this is a testament to Apple's ingenuity. Or perhaps it is merely greed.Overall, these earphones are extremely good. The sound will satisfy all but the most discerning listeners and, as my experience has proved, they will continue to work until you lose them. If Apple had priced them $5-10 less, I think they would have complete control over the earphone market at the under $50 price range.",4.0,1,earphones best earphones apple made thus far far ive seen extremely durable pair came iphone survived washed dried pair bought amazon survived sucked vacuum cleaner also think worth mentioning use shower lot albeit dont get actually wet keep head dry use phone waterproof case significance frequently survive humiditythe sound also much better sound apples old earphones sound stays constant across board although speak sound volume never listen high seem hit sounds accurately across board reach low lows high highs however still manage hit many lows many highs anyone isnt discerning musical taste happy thesethey also fit well listen music hours without discomfort arent even ears sometimes im listening song havent heard theres something odd like sound airplane going someone calling pop one even sure sound isnt real impressive furthermore drop phone youre listening pressure seems equally displaced across ear making drop much less painful old apple earbudsadditionally audio jack seems much durable part tends major failing earbuds since drop phone accidentally pull away laptop rolling chair pressure action focused jack however part held extremely well impressivethe reason havent given product five stars simply price im quite sure whether buying another pair earbuds would better value money furthermore regardless whether could buy pair better value im sure apple could priced lower undoubtedly made factory china cents perhaps testament apples ingenuity perhaps merely greedoverall earphones extremely good sound satisfy discerning listeners experience proved continue work lose apple priced less think would complete control earphone market price range

The ears of millions of people who wouldn't upgrade anyway are in for a treat, but if you're comfortable with over-the-ear or in-canal style those headphones, those styles will block more outside noise.  These aren't the most detailed or cleanest sounding earphones either, but for a set of earbuds, they are grand, and a good deal at $29.Review -Gizmodo just ran a hit piece on the EarPods, labelling them crap and not worth $29.  Almost every other tech site to review them has been impressed, so I let my curiosity lead me to my local Apple Store and grabbed a set.  My bundled Apple earbuds had broken months ago and I have a number of other headphones in various styles handy for comparison.My immediate first impression of the EarPods was on a voice call that was still in progress when I got to the Apple Store and checked out.  Caller's voice was clear and she heard me well over the din of the store.  This functionality has always been a highlight of the bundled Apple 'phones, even if sound quality wasn't so great.I queued up ""Busy Bodies"" by Elvis Costello and the first thing I thought was ""yuk!""  Treble was sharp and painful.  Bass is there and much improved from the previous earbuds - in fact, this is probably the best element of the EarPods sound.  This is NOT Beats by Dre levels of bass emphasis.  I have Skullcandy Titans in my bag also - those headphones have lots of bass and require a bass reducer EQ.  These EarPods have excellent, well balanced bass.Moved on to ""Lucky"" by the Gaslight Anthem.  Same impression - too much happening up top to enjoy the music.  It seems like the aiming of the driver does improve how much noise you hear from outside, but you will still want to be careful not to turn these up too high.Joni Mitchell, Big Boi, Guided by Voices, I tried a lot of different stuff and decided these needed the treble reducer EQ engaged.  With the treble dialed down, these are a much more listenable headphone.  Cymbals are much more natural and the whole presentation benefits.The do stay in my ears better and they are very comfortable.  Time will tell on durability, but they seem solid.  I think these are an excellent freebie and an OK aftermarket purchase.  I'll update this review if I encounter any problems with durability.  I think I'll switch to these as my everyday headphones - at work and commuting, you need to hear around you.All told, a solid update.",4.0,1,pros much better bass response previous earbudscomfortableno rubber trim flake offexcellent button remotemic convenient access siri voice control playpause etccons treble get sibilantclipped higher volumesmids sound little dry overwhelmed harsh trebleearbuds isolationgood values headphones remotemicsummary excellent update ubiquitous product ears millions people wouldnt upgrade anyway treat youre comfortable overtheear incanal style headphones styles block outside noise arent detailed cleanest sounding earphones either set earbuds grand good deal gizmodo ran hit piece earpods labelling crap worth almost every tech site review impressed let curiosity lead local apple store grabbed set bundled apple earbuds broken months ago number headphones various styles handy comparisonmy immediate first impression earpods voice call still progress got apple store checked callers voice clear heard well din store functionality always highlight bundled apple phones even sound quality wasnt greati queued busy bodies elvis costello first thing thought yuk treble sharp painful bass much improved previous earbuds fact probably best element earpods sound beats dre levels bass emphasis skullcandy titans bag also headphones lots bass require bass reducer eq earpods excellent well balanced bassmoved lucky gaslight anthem impression much happening top enjoy music seems like aiming driver improve much noise hear outside still want careful turn highjoni mitchell big boi guided voices tried lot different stuff decided needed treble reducer eq engaged treble dialed much listenable headphone cymbals much natural whole presentation benefitsthe stay ears better comfortable time tell durability seem solid think excellent freebie ok aftermarket purchase ill update review encounter problems durability think ill switch everyday headphones work commuting need hear around youall told solid update

The Zeimax only cost $6, (about 25% of the cost of the Apple version), so I took a chance on them.  Now I know what good audio sounds like, after comparing the Apple EarPods (excellent sound quality) to the inferior Zeimax EarPods (hollow and muddy sounding).  Also, the Zeimax were lighter, they rattled when shaken, and they broke after four days, (the right EarPod fell to pieces); whereas the Apple EarPods are solidly made, and they last much longer.I have had 4 or 5 pairs of Apple EarPods because they DO break if you treat them roughly.  The EarPods themselves are very sturdy and I have never broken those, but the cable will fray or become damaged internally if they are snagged and pulled on something very sharply.  But I mostly have myself to blame for that, because I let the cable hang out of my pocket, with the iPhone and EarPods in the pocket, when the EarPods are not in my ears.

458,"A personal thumbs-up for these things, I really love them. The sound quality is excellent, the basses are good and deep, and there's little sound bleed-out unless they're at top volume. The mic in the control has made itself very very useful; I can have a convo on the phone without having to put down my stitching or letting the computer sit idle. Yes, I know that's what Bluetooth is for, but I don't need to fuss about with a separate device, now, do I, which is good, because I hate that (which is why I don't have a separate iPod). The remote works great, and I don't have to take my iPhone out of my pocket when I'm listening to something in order to adjust volume or change the track. One serious advantage for me that I hadn't anticipated: they're comfortable enough that I can easily fall asleep wearing them (which means Bono sings me to sleep a lot--rather an intimate series of encounters for a man I've never actually met). I seem to always have them in, which is a testament to their comfort in that I often forget I'm even wearing them.

484,"I received these as a gift recently and was curious to see whether I could use them as back-up for when I forgot my main earbuds. After looking at reviews all over out of curiosity (determining whether to sell them), I decided to give them a shot. Unfortunately I made the wrong choice. In comparison to other earbuds at their price range, they're not horrible in the sound area, but the comfort leaves way too much to be desired.Sound:Apple has applied a better range of frequency to the product, enabling the bass to come through a bit more than prior default earbuds (received with an iPod, etc.), and more than some of their equal value competition, but still really doesn't impress. Even though it doesn't sound like it's overloading, much of the bass still comes through as more of a 'buzz' than real quality bass. The clarity is actually somewhat impressive however, enabling distinct instruments to be heard within a song. Being used to earbuds that are &#34;inserted&#34; in the ear and not &#34;hung&#34; on the ear, there is an obvious loss of sound isolation as outside sounds are able to reach your ear canal.Comfort:I have to disclaim that perhaps I'm just a bit biased in this category because I've never enjoyed earbuds that hang on my ear (again, rather than being inserted), but it's hard for me to fathom anyone enjoying that feeling. I guess it's just an acquired feel. Although I've given them many tries, I can't get used to the feeling that the earbuds are ready to fall out of my ear at any given moment--they're completely useless while running or being active in any capacity.So the only real kudos I can give these is for their 'not terrible sound' and potential comfort that don't mind hanging earbuds. For me though, they're pretty worthless.Credibility: many years comparative listening experience as an avid music lover and music artist/writer/engineer/producer.",2.0,0,received gift recently curious see whether could use backup forgot main earbuds looking reviews curiosity determining whether sell decided give shot unfortunately made wrong choice comparison earbuds price range theyre horrible sound area comfort leaves way much desiredsoundapple applied better range frequency product enabling bass come bit prior default earbuds received ipod etc equal value competition still really doesnt impress even though doesnt sound like overloading much bass still comes buzz real quality bass clarity actually somewhat impressive however enabling distinct instruments heard within song used earbuds ear ear obvious loss sound isolation outside sounds able reach ear canalcomforti disclaim perhaps im bit biased category ive never enjoyed earbuds hang ear rather inserted hard fathom anyone enjoying feeling guess acquired feel although ive given many tries cant get used feeling earbuds ready fall ear given momenttheyre completely useless running active capacityso real kudos give terrible sound potential comfort dont mind hanging earbuds though theyre pretty worthlesscredibility many years comparative listening experience avid music lover music artistwriterengineerproducer
485,"Like every other guy says  here,  I'm no audiophile.  I don't have headphones or earbuds that cost anywhere from three hundred dollars to well over a thousand.  I'm strictly a recreational/casual listener who would like a decent,  if affordably priced set of of buds.  I've  tried many in the low to mid range market,  including the often loathed Skull Candys, (Titan, Ink'd) JVC Marshmallows,  Sony, Sennheiser CX150's , and even a pair of Bose 's  supposedly higher end Mie2's.Well,  I'll tell you that these Apple buds stack up and beat all of those,  including the Bose buds,  which are around a hundred bucks.The base has just the right amount of punchiness,  without muddiness overwhelming anything.  Balanced base that sounds good on r&b;, hip hop,  rock or pop music.  The vocals are crisp,  and don't get drowned out by the rest of the sound that I noticed on the others -- yes,  even the Bose.  The treble --  undoubtedly the biggest negative in lower end earbuds --  is solid, with not a lot of distortion even with the volume maxed.The design of these new buds is great.  The rounded cone shape makes them extremely comfortable,  and the external speakers are located on the forward part entering the ear canal,  as well as a side port,  which according to Apple,  is supposed to improve sound onmid level tones,  as well as improve air flow for better overall sound quality.  Apple also improved the cable wrapping on the wires,  to reduce strain when pulling -- something notorious for easy breakage on their previous buds.The buds are more resistant to water and sweat,  too,  and can be used for moderate to heavy exercise.  I had no problems when using them for a 4 mile run.  These are not listed as noise canceling,  but do a good job blocking out external sounds.  They fit well in people with medium to large ears (can't tell you if they'll work for the small eared folks).  The microphone works as well as any other mic'd buds I've used.  One minor gripe:  I think Apple put  the mic and volume controls to close to the ear.  I like them lower on the cable for better access when running.All around,  I was very pleasantly surprised with these new buds.  They hold up well to any others in the price range,  and even managed to best my  $110.00 Bose Mie2's in overall sound quality,  making me all the more disappointed in Bose.  Just want good, inexpensive buds?

535,"My dog ate my only pair of Apple iPhone factory headphones WITH microphone earlier this week (no lie - she's a Boxer puppy and it was raining here that day and these things happen).  I rely heavily on them because I'm cheap and refuse to install a $350+ iphone adapter to my car when I can just plug headphones in my ears and then answer a call easily while driving.  I really had nothing against the factory set.  They, and their un-microphoned predecessors have worked just fine for me over the years.  No, those aren't the MOST comfy, but I could deal.  Plus, the dog has a propensity for headphones and those I could buy in sets of 3.  The fact is, I LOVE having the remote and microphone attached.  For this, they ranked at the top of my most-used electronics list.  Life was a challenge not having them for 3 days.However, I decided it was time for an upgrade, and I looked at most of what Amazon offers in the $10-30 range for headphones with a microphone, and even some of the $80 ones, but remember, I'm not one to part with a buck for just anything.  I was surprised to come across these - I must not have seen that they'd even come out, despite my recent iPad and relatively new iPhone 4s purchases.  After reading many reviews (just like you're doing), I thought I'd go ahead and trust Apple on this one.  Heavens to Betsy, these are amazing!  The sound quality is killer whether you're rocking some Classical, yoga music (yeah, I listen to yoga music a lot, and you should too), T-Swift (don't judge), or hard rock (which can also be fun to do yoga to).  And the call quality is perfect.  The test call to the husband was flawless on both ends.  Audiobooks have more depth than before too (except for 50 Shades of Grey which has virtually no depth - not the earbuds fault, I assure you.  Hello annoying narrator-much?).  And, they are the most comfortable things ever!  I went for an hour run and they didn't fall out or slip, even though I didn't believe that to be possible with any earbud.Long story short, you should buy these.  Even I could justify parting with the $27 for them.  In fact I was pleased that I didn't have to spend $80 to get this amazing quality, because I'd still be using the old factory Apple ones instead.

The built in remote is very handy for volume control as well as pause/play and track skips. Only real complaint I have is the microphone for phone calls its sub-par.

556,"Get these.I'm used to the bad old days when Apple earbuds were a step above a 99-cent pair from Walmart. They have come a long way.Sound Quality: Crystal clear, excellent at all frequencies. Even the bass has a serious kick, which is very rare in this style of earbud. I own a pair of Bose over-ear headphones, and actually find myself wearing these more.Functionality: Having a volume control AND play/pause button hanging right by my neck is so helpful. No longer do I have to dig the phone out of my pocket to adjust the volume. The buttons work when the headphones are plugged into iPhones, iPods, iPads, and even my MacBook Pro. The play/pause button opens iTunes on my computer, and also plays/pauses/controls the master volume. Very nifty. I think I would rather have a skip button, but being able to pause is pretty handy too.Calls: If I'm listening to music on my phone and a call comes, I can answer it with the button on the earbuds. The music pauses automatically. Amazingly, I can use them to carry on a conversation in pretty much any condition, and the people I'm talking to can still hear me loud and clear.If you have a non-Apple device, the controls may not work the same.

594,"Apple has a video on their website describing the new ""Earpod's"" headphones that I believe now come standard with the iPhone, this video was what sold me on the new Re-design of Apple's classic trendy white headphones that you see in commercials and everywhere on the streets, subways and on busses. That video describes the way that Johnny Ive and his team assembled and redesigned these new headphones to fit any ear and sound much better. see the video here: [...]That video sold me on these headphones before I ever even heard them, but once I did, I decided to review my experience.The first thing that I noticed is that the Bass is unbelievable for small in-ear headphones, it reminds me of home stereo sound with it's rich robust bass and nice overall frequency response. I have never heard bass like this in headphones before, especially headphones this small.The high's which are very important to me are not compromised in any way by the smooth mid range or the new added bass frequencies, and the volume can get very loud if I want to turn it up and rock out for a little while.Built-in Microphone is really nice feature for taking calls while listening to music. Volume controls work much better because their size and feel is slightly thicker than before and have a nice feel with a little more room to travel when you are clicking them gives feedback to know that you are actually clicking a button rather than squeezing hard like before.There is no longer a rubber ring to help hold the headphones in your ear, which is a good thing because the rubber ring wore out over time on my original headphones, these are shaped to fit any ear ""by design"". They fit great and sound even better.It also controls Siri for iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 users, but I only have the iPhone 4 which doesn't have Siri.Pressing the center button brings up the voice prompt commands that work similarly to the way Siri works to control the music and use voice commands to do a variety of things but without the added Siri search technology and other services.Much cheaper and sound just as good, and more functional than a lot of other third-party headphones that cost a fortune like beats by dr. dre, $300??? what a laugh!!! These are one tenth the price and that is a good thing in case they get lost, stolen or damaged, they are easier to replace.Thanks Apple, you outdid yourself on this redesign of your classic headphones.",5.0,1,apple video website describing new earpods headphones believe come standard iphone video sold new redesign apples classic trendy white headphones see commercials everywhere streets subways busses video describes way johnny ive team assembled redesigned new headphones fit ear sound much better see video video sold headphones ever even heard decided review experiencethe first thing noticed bass unbelievable small inear headphones reminds home stereo sound rich robust bass nice overall frequency response never heard bass like headphones especially headphones smallthe highs important compromised way smooth mid range new added bass frequencies volume get loud want turn rock little whilebuiltin microphone really nice feature taking calls listening music volume controls work much better size feel slightly thicker nice feel little room travel clicking gives feedback know actually clicking button rather squeezing hard like beforethere longer rubber ring help hold headphones ear good thing rubber ring wore time original headphones shaped fit ear design fit great sound even betterit also controls siri iphone iphone users iphone doesnt siripressing center button brings voice prompt commands work similarly way siri works control music use voice commands variety things without added siri search technology servicesmuch cheaper sound good functional lot thirdparty headphones cost fortune like beats dr dre laugh one tenth price good thing case get lost stolen damaged easier replacethanks apple outdid redesign classic headphones

If you are unfamiliar with this new style, the shape is a bit different and was designed to fit the ear better with the sound opening located in a place that is more compatible with the human ear.

She insisted that the volume was not loud and when I checked, she was right.  The earbuds she had been using just didn't fit quite right --- she has used both the round buds that come with the iPod and the bullet-shaped ones that fit a bit better, but neither fit well.  These new iPod earbuds, on the other hand, are a perfect fit and we no longer hear the music bleeding out from the earbuds while riding in the car together.

However, many audio products these days boast better bass, and I don't want people to overhype these earphones. They LOOK really good, because their predecessors sucked to begin with. Bass can be somewhat muddy, and highs and mids are average. And though Apple thankfully improved the design so sound goes into your ear canal, the earpods feel insecure. They've never fell out of my ears yet, but I've noticed many an occasion where I have reached up and fiddled with the fit, only to realize they were in place, and just felt insecure.Overall, no shame in these headphones, but if you're buying a replacement pair for $30, try and look for something better before picking these up.

693,"These earbuds are the very first ""iProduct"" manufactured by Apple, Inc. that I've ever owned. I'm currently using them in conjunction with my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone and using the paid version of PowerAmp media player (with its glorious 11-band equalizer). Let me first say that I listen to music constantly ranging from Above & Beyond to Keith Urban to U2 to Muse to Two Steps From Hell to Pendulum. A wide range of all genres.Sound Quality: this is top priority for me. I'm coming from a pair ofSony MDR-XB41EX Extra Bass Headphonesthat I thought sounded good... not anymore. They pale in comparison to these. The new Apple Earpods are the greatest earbuds I've ever heard. The frequency response is natural, yet pleasantly dynamic, reaching all ranges of the spectrum. Sound is crisp, clear, and present, thanks to the strategically placed sound vents in the side of each earpod (place your finger over one of them and you'll see what I'm talking about). They DO NOT sound like they're in a can. Bass response is sharp with no noticeable distortion unless you really overdrive the equalizer. I am very impressed. I use the equalizer on my phone to bump up the treble just a notch and add about 6dB on the 31hz band, making for a great rumble of the lowest of lows. They still don't distort, though I doubt they would work very well with much more than their recommended power input. But they utilize that tiny amount of power very well. They reach comfortable volumes easily and can really belt out loud notes when I crank it up. They could do with a bit more ""headroom"" but that is just me being picky - for earbuds to use with a phone or a portable player, I think they're about as close to perfect as one can get.Fit/Comfort: This is my only gripe with these. It took some getting used to at first, since I was coming from the silicon inserts of the Sony XB41EX earbuds mentioned above, which are very comfortable. These have a hard shell, so at first they made me a tad sore. But after I learned how to insert and remove them properly, I'm pleased with their comfort. For best fit, I make sure the ""stalk"" for lack of a better term is pressed against my ear, and the interior seems to line up well with my ear canal. Mind you, I also have very small ears and small ear canals as well, and these fit comfortably. I can wear them for extended periods at work between phone calls. (I do insert and remove them OFTEN when I'm at work, and there's been little irritation.) They do stay in very well. You have to want to remove them to get them to come out.Durability: I've owned these since Mid-December 2012, and they're still holding up well. The cord gets tangled occasionally and I have to untwist them (a problem I never had with the Sonys due to their tangle-free flat cord). I do not store these in case and several times a day they're slammed down onto my desk at work as I answer the phone in a hurry. They're still belting out the tunes like the first day I had them and show no signs of breakage or any noticeable wear.Background noise / sound leak:  Sound doesn't leak out very much at all. Though we have white-noise machines in my office, I can hardly hear what's playing on mid-volume with the earbuds out of my ears. They do let in some outside noise though. This is actually what I was looking for when I purchased these initially - so that I could hear my phone more easily, or hear the jokes and humorous gripes coming from my coworkers who sit around me. I wouldn't count on them though if you're looking for something to block out sound. No noise-cancelling here.Bottom line: Regardless of price, if you are looking for a near-perfect set of portable headphones for general use, exercise, or a dull office environment, these work well. They are WELL worth the money. I won't be buying any others unless these break, then I'll be coming back for another set of Earpods.PS: If anyone from Apple reads this: DON'T CHANGE A THING. EVER.

They keep falling out.  Other companies have different adapters for various ear sizes, but these are just one size.  I guess that if you are that average person they are decent low to mid end earbuds.  If your ears are small or big you will hate those.  Another thing that I find annoying is that they are definitely on the quiet side even when turned all the way up.  Yet another thing is that they don't ""lock"" into your ear like the ones with the rubber adapters do so they release a lot of noise to the people around you, like everyone can hear what you are hearing.

741,"These earbuds are my most frequently used pair... and yet I own a pair of Bose mIE2s ($129), Klipsch S4is ($99), and a pair Denon AH-D2000 over-the-ear headphones ($400-450). As you probably have guessed, I've given these away or sold them after buying the EarPods.The reason being is, I think, that these buds fit my ears perfectly. I have relatively large ears and stand at 6 feet tall with a broad build. I leave them in for up to 6 hours at a time, like on plane rides, and they never bother me or cause any pain or pressure. They do not move about all that much, and even when they do, the effect on the sound quality is minimal!The sound quality? Perfect for me, second only to my $450 Denon cans. I hate buds that either have stuffy, muddy bass, AND/OR tin-can-aluminum-foil-rattling trebles with every snare or cymbal, or every time the singer pronounces the letter ""s"". It's not natural, and it PAINS my ears. So many buds, even in the expensive ranges, try to ""enhance"" the quality of the music by enhancing highs and lows, but not the mids. These buds have the COMPLETE package, with bass when it should be there, crisp highs when they're SUPPOSED to be there, and consistent mids that bring out vocals, strings, and most instrumentals.To my ears, these sound very close to the Bose mIE2s. The bass character is almost identical, punchy and not muddy, and like the Bose headphones, the midrange is favored. Nowhere to be found are the tin-can like trebles produced by the previous generation of standard Apple buds. Yet, vocals come through very clearly, and lyrics are easily distinguishable. Guitar strums sound nice and crisp, but without the sharp static buzz produced by low-quality buds. Classical music is fantastic on these; they accurately reproduce not only the music but the tone and quality of the instruments used to play it. Violin, viola, and cello, for example, are easily distinguishable. This was not always the case with the previous Apple earbuds.These buds have noticeably more bass than Beats by Dr. Dre Tour earbuds. They have way more bass than the Klipsch S4i buds. And mind you, I AM wearing those buds correctly with an airtight seal. Not only is there MORE bass - the bass is richer and never interferes with the rest of the sound by distorting mids.Sound bleeding is also much improved with these buds! Instead of bouncing the sound off your ear surface into the air around you, it really feeds the sound right into your ear canal, and nobody around me ever complained about hearing my music rattling through my ears. Because of this, I also don't have to listen to my music as loudly as before to hear all the details I want to get. The cable is also nicely textured and rubbery and never gets stiff and in your way. The cable is a little SHORT for my liking; I stand at six feet tall and from my pocket the cord is JUST enough to reach under my jacket and through to my ears. The remote is also well-placed, on the right branch a few inches below the right bud, so that it's easily accessible even if you have a jacket on over the main cable. The remote works very well, and the buttons have great feedback, and you know where your finger is because of the indentation over the play/pause/call/Siri button. The microphone also sounds great and works just as well as holding the phone to your ear for calling. So far, everything has seemed pretty weather-resistant. I've been out in the rain/snow with these - no problem.However, these are obviously NOT $1,000 headphones. They just aren't as detailed as those headphones are, but for general, all-purpose listening, these are fantastic and I have yet to find a pair to rival them at the sub-$100 price range. And these are only $29! These, to me, alone are a huge selling point for Apple's music players and mobile devices. Great headphones bundled with your device make all the difference.I have read so many online journals and magazines and newspapers that reviewed these headphones to be a ""marginal improvement over the previous generation"". I don't even know where to begin.... Engadget, CNET, what were you ON? These do not sound REMOTELY like the previous Apple earbuds. Try them out for yourself before you buy them. I really think you'll be pleased by these.Apple CAN make good earbuds after all. Just give them a fighting chance before you shun them just because a computer and phone company made them!

Comparing the earpods with the older Apple earphones, the earpods definitely scored the sound accuracy points since the speakers are right inside your ear canal. But be warned! There is a downside to these earpods. They do NOT isolate outside noise. So if your looking for noise isolating earphones, you might want to look elsewhere. Another warning, be very careful when buying these earpods on eBay, there is a high chance of buying the cheaper generic brand, which may be very different in terms of performance. But aside from all that, I'm very happy with these earpods.",4.0,1,first skeptical unusual design earphones tweaking placements earpods sound incredible comparing earpods older apple earphones earpods definitely scored sound accuracy points since speakers right inside ear canal warned downside earpods isolate outside noise looking noise isolating earphones might want look elsewhere another warning careful buying earpods ebay high chance buying cheaper generic brand may different terms performance aside im happy earpods
807,"A couple of weeks ago I decided to buy a new pair of headphones since my last ones gave out on my, so I decided to by one of those in ear headphones ( earbuds) and hated them since they always kept sliding out of my ear every time I went for a run or got on the treadmill. After that epic failure I decided to experiment with some other headphones and just hated the quality. It was not until last week when I watched the Apple keynote with their new updates and since they announced some new headphones, I decided to try them out.Went to the apple store the very next day and purchased the new earpods. As soon as I left the store, I connected them to my iPod and was amazed by the quality of the sound. The way that the earpods direct music into your ear without having to shove the whole thing into your ear canal is ingenious.The Bass on these headphones are pretty decent, it's at a perfect level and it doesn't over do it like other headphones do.The earpods are very comfortable and when it comes to running with them, I actually ran 4 miles yesterday over at central park and they never fell out.The controls work perfectly, not only on my iPhone, but on my iPad as well. To use Siri I simply hold the middle of the volume rocker, to skip a song just click it twice and to go back click 3 times. To pause and play or even answer a call just click the middle once.I'm very pleased with the earpods, it's about time someone came out with something different. hopefully this will become the new standard.Music I've listend to with these headphones ( Electronic Dance Music, Dubstep, trance, Ambient, Rock, Alternative, Acoustic +more) All sound Amaizing.",5.0,1,couple weeks ago decided buy new pair headphones since last ones gave decided one ear headphones earbuds hated since always kept sliding ear every time went run got treadmill epic failure decided experiment headphones hated quality last week watched apple keynote new updates since announced new headphones decided try outwent apple store next day purchased new earpods soon left store connected ipod amazed quality sound way earpods direct music ear without shove whole thing ear canal ingeniousthe bass headphones pretty decent perfect level doesnt like headphones dothe earpods comfortable comes running actually ran miles yesterday central park never fell outthe controls work perfectly iphone ipad well use siri simply hold middle volume rocker skip song click twice go back click times pause play even answer call click middle onceim pleased earpods time someone came something different hopefully become new standardmusic ive listend headphones electronic dance music dubstep trance ambient rock alternative acoustic sound amaizing

811,"I was so excited when these first arrived. I thought, wow, free headphones with my iPod that actually sound bearable? May be too good to be true...But it was true. These buds sound amazing for being $29 headphones that come free with your iDevice. I'm not exaggerating when I say that they rival earbuds in the class of the Bose MiE2s and the Klipsch S4 series. I actually prefer these over the in-ear style of the KIipsch S4, as they are far more comfortable. They don't block outside noise as well as an in-ear headphone, but they also barely bleed sound at all compared to the previous generation of Apple earbuds. This design makes them great for working out, as in-ear earbuds often &#34;pop&#34; in your ear when the wires are tugged by motion.They aren't audiophile grade earbuds, though, and you can tell. While the bass really resonates in these tiny plastic buds, the trebles can be a tad bit too sharp. Just a tad. However, the vocals sound much warmer than they do on other headphones in the price range. If they're too small for your ears, adding some foamies helps make a better sit in your ear, and will make them sound better. They sound great with a whole variety of different kinds of music.They work great for phone calls - the inline microphone seems to work just as well as an iPhone's built in mouthpiece.The inline controls can be finicky, and I never think Apple did them right. Hitting play/pause gives a noticeable lag, and double/triple tapping to skip track and return to previous track often don't register properly. They work on Mac computers, too, FYI.Just as a side note - they do NOT come with the iPod shuffle. Don't let Apple trick you!The price, attractive design, inline mic and controls and great sound quality make this my go-to earbud when I'm out and about with my iPhone. They don't seal out too much sound which makes them safer, in my opinion, while walking on a street or crossing roads.

831,"Update 9/20: For some reason these do not work on the third generation shuffle, it will skip tracks but will not adjust the volume.Since posting the original review I have tested them in active situations and they fall out like the others. Foamies help but they don't seem to completely stop them from falling out.I would like to clarify my original view, these aren't as good as the more expensive sets but for $29 it is a great deal for a pair to throw around when you don't want to take you're several hundred dollar set out.Downgraded to 4 star because of wear issues and incompatibility with the 3rd gen shuffle.These buds are incredible, the bass is strong and the fullness is superior to the previous generation buds that came with iPods. These are bass heavy buds so if you are more concerned with balance (equal distribution between low,mids,highs) you may want to consider looking elsewhere.FORGET what you know about the previous generation buds, these are the real deal.I've bought dozens of cheap pairs and more expensive models including Sennheiser HD485s, HD555s, Audio-technica ATH-M40fs, Klipsch One, and Bose OEs. These destroy anything in the $30 price range and rival the $100+ pairs I have.These are no doubt the best earbuds (not in-ear or cans) on the market.The 5 star rating is based on price/performance ratio...you won't find a better performing pair of earbuds at such a cheap price.The only concern I have is the ability of the buds to stay in place while being active, I have not tested this yet.

888,"When I came to read other reviews I fully expected to see a bunch of haters give this product a one star. Like most people around the world in the past when a new apple product with headphones came out I would throw them in a place of no return. Those old earphones sounded like life in eternal hell with Fran Dresser with strip throat. When I brought my new ipod touch I forgot my headphones and I wasn't going to be able to use them until the very end of the day. When I put the earpods in I was blown away. The cost is 30 bucks yet they sound like a pair of $100 dollar earbuds. The weirdest part is they were designed to let in noise. Normally that would drive me nuts but some how the designer wanted control of that noise so it will seamlessly fit into what your ears heard. The good news is if you are ever running and an ax murderer and spring behind, your ears will seamlessly pick up that noise with out distorting your jams.I wouldn't call myself an audiophile but I do listen to hip-hop, podcast, and audiobooks. With hip-hop you have to have the best earphones or the bass will distort everything. I am not rich so I have just a couple pair of $100 earphones. These ear pods can compete with those two pairs I have.When I buy new headphones I look for this; can I hear something new in the song I can hear? That is as simple as I can explain it. With the ear pods they do past the test.The tricky part is having the right ears for them. They are shape oddly but it is done with intent to fit as many ears as possible. I would guess that if a person has small ear holes then these maybe won't be the best pair. Still give them a try because Apple will return the item as long as it is within 14 days of purchase.With me they fit my right ear perfectly but with the left I have to readjust during times when I am power walking through town. If you need buds to work out at the gym these probably won't be perfect. For light activity, yes.

918,"To be honest, I must first say that I have never been a fan of any Apple product, and that these ""EarPods"" are the first Apple product I've tried in more years than I care to count.  I got the new EarPods in desperation, looking for a set of earphones - any brand, any style, any ANYTHING under $50 - that wouldn't end up giving me an earache after just a short period of use.  These do the trick.I use earphones almost exclusively to listen to audiobooks on my SanDisk Sansa Clip, though I also occasionally listen to classical music.  The EarPods really have pretty reasonable sound quality, in addition to not hurting my ears or giving me an earache, and staying in place while I move around.  No, the volume controls and mike don't work on a non-Apple product (one of my main complaints about Apple concerns the proprietary restraints they place on all of their products), but for how I use them, that's not a big problem.  The price seems somewhat high to me for the overall quality (another one of my complaints about Apple products), but then, perhaps I shouldn't complain about $30 when I've finally got a pair of earphones I can actually use.Much as I hate to admit it, yes, the EarPods are worth five stars.",5.0,1,honest must first say never fan apple product earpods first apple product ive tried years care count got new earpods desperation looking set earphones brand style anything wouldnt end giving earache short period use tricki use earphones almost exclusively listen audiobooks sandisk sansa clip though also occasionally listen classical music earpods really pretty reasonable sound quality addition hurting ears giving earache staying place move around volume controls mike dont work nonapple product one main complaints apple concerns proprietary restraints place products use thats big problem price seems somewhat high overall quality another one complaints apple products perhaps shouldnt complain ive finally got pair earphones actually usemuch hate admit yes earpods worth five stars

947,"Out of my small earphone collection (Monoprice 108320, Soundmagic e10, Vsonic GR06, old Apple earbuds, a cheap sub-10$ set, and the Earpods), all of which are under 100$, the apple Earpods remain my favorite.First of all, the build quality is nice; I have slept with this on, and they have been able to withstand my everyday abuse (dropping, tugging, and stepping on them). After 6 months of everyday casual listening, there has been no noticeable physical damage, and sound quality has also been retained. Packaging is well done: Simple hard-paper box and includes a small hard plastic case that you can wrap your Earpods in. The remote also works fine, except for the fact that it sometimes mistakes my double-clicks for a single-click.SOUND QUALITY:Overall:This impression is mostly based on its performance compared to the other sets i own.The sound quality coming from these earphones is MUCH better than that of their predecessor: the old stock apple earbuds. Clarity is much better, and presentation of details are also improved.Compared to my other sets, the Earpods have a considerable advantage in airiness and punchiness. This means the Earpods present drums and quick beats very clearly. Instrument separation is stepped up because of this as well. To describe this sound signature with one word would be: clean. Because of this, vocals are forward in a way that they are isolated and distinguishable from the instrumentals, not over-powering and bleeding into other sounds.There is little to no isolation because they are earbuds, not IEMs, but they fit into my ear very well. As a result, listening to these in noisy environments hinders their performance considerably, as they are also vented earbuds.COMPARISONS:(All compared sets have been burned-in for at least 50 hours of pink noise+frequency sweeps and 100+ hours of casual listening)Vsonic GR06:My more expensive set, the Vsonic GR06 (80$ Amazon), are very warm and mid-centric compared to my Earpods. They present very intimate vocals and mid-range notes well, but have thin/recessed highs. The Earpods, however, have a more equal sound and have full (adequate) presentation through lows, mids, and highs. Cleaner drums and sharper notes are a plus too. As a result, the Earpods win for me, an avid listener of busy music with many instruments playing at one time (Jpop/Jrock mostly). However, the full-bodied mids makes me go back to the Vsonics every week or so to enjoy its contrasting sound signature.Soundmagic E10:The Soundmagic E10s, at roughly the same price (35$ Amazon), leans toward the bass in it's overall presentation. It's sound signature is slightly warm. The highs were noticeably thin like the GR06, and the overall sound was slightly tinny. I actually slightly preferred the older Apple earbuds over these for that reason. This may have more of an impact on my impressions because of the type of music i listen to (Jpop/Jrock). The Earpods just have less of that very slight ""static-y"" sound coming from the E10s, and also have a more controlled/tight bass in my opinion.Monoprice 108320:The Monoprice 108320s have gotten considerable praise for the sound quality they deliver at their 10$ price tag. My overall impressions were that this set was thinner/tinny compared to the Earpods. They also had less dynamics, and i felt that i needed to turn up the volume more to enjoy my music. The 108320s were also flatter/more-equal in their overall presentation.As sound quality is VERY subjective, I advise you to consider other sets, and possibly audition some if you have the chance. However, if you do enjoy the same genre of music as me (Jpop/Jrock), I can stand by the Earpods and say they do a very good job. I also stress that they do considerably better than the other sets i described above, and that you should probably choose the Earpods if you are choosing between them and the other sets I talked about.NOTE: This review was written in hopes to prevent superfluous spending on new earbuds (like I did to an extent), so I apologize if my descriptions come off as verbose.Hope this helps.",5.0,1,small earphone collection monoprice soundmagic vsonic old apple earbuds cheap set earpods apple earpods remain favoritefirst build quality nice slept able withstand everyday abuse dropping tugging stepping months everyday casual listening noticeable physical damage sound quality also retained packaging well done simple hardpaper box includes small hard plastic case wrap earpods remote also works fine except fact sometimes mistakes doubleclicks singleclicksound qualityoverallthis impression mostly based performance compared sets ownthe sound quality coming earphones much better predecessor old stock apple earbuds clarity much better presentation details also improvedcompared sets earpods considerable advantage airiness punchiness means earpods present drums quick beats clearly instrument separation stepped well describe sound signature one word would clean vocals forward way isolated distinguishable instrumentals overpowering bleeding soundsthere little isolation earbuds iems fit ear well result listening noisy environments hinders performance considerably also vented earbudscomparisonsall compared sets burnedin least hours pink noisefrequency sweeps hours casual listeningvsonic expensive set vsonic amazon warm midcentric compared earpods present intimate vocals midrange notes well thinrecessed highs earpods however equal sound full adequate presentation lows mids highs cleaner drums sharper notes plus result earpods win avid listener busy music many instruments playing one time jpopjrock mostly however fullbodied mids makes go back vsonics every week enjoy contrasting sound signaturesoundmagic soundmagic roughly price amazon leans toward bass overall presentation sound signature slightly warm highs noticeably thin like overall sound slightly tinny actually slightly preferred older apple earbuds reason may impact impressions type music listen jpopjrock earpods less slight staticy sound coming also controlledtight bass opinionmonoprice monoprice gotten considerable praise sound quality deliver price tag overall impressions set thinnertinny compared earpods also less dynamics felt needed turn volume enjoy music also flattermoreequal overall presentationas sound quality subjective advise consider sets possibly audition chance however enjoy genre music jpopjrock stand earpods say good job also stress considerably better sets described probably choose earpods choosing sets talked aboutnote review written hopes prevent superfluous spending new earbuds like extent apologize descriptions come verbosehope helps

982,"I like these earbuds a lot. (And I won't bother with cheap knockoffs.) These Apple EarPods are the best I've ever owned (and I've owned something like 5 different earphones.) The new ""anatomical"" design is excellent and SOOO comfortable! As usual, Apple innovates. They buds stay nicely snug in my ears but are comfortable, without any pressure. Without constant adjusting and I can move, work, walk and even run and then tend to stay secure in my ears. The sound quality is excellent. I mostly listen to books and these buds have very little sibilance problems (common with other earphones.) The base tones are rich and strong, but the sound is nicely even - I don't have to keep adjusting the volume.The other nice thing about these buds is that outside sounds get through nicely, for safety's sake and so your family won't think you've completely tuned them out!The only thing that remains to be seen is how well they hold up.March 4, 2013RIP my Apple Earpods as of mid-day today. The right earphone has almost no sound. I can hear it, but it's very faint. So, I've had these since early October (coincidentally, they were ordered on the 4th)which means they lasted 5 months. So, am I unhappy? I don't think so.I use them with my IPhone, IPad and IPod. And I use my IPod a lot it is almost always on my person, usually tucked in a front pocket, with the Earbuds either in my ears or draped over my shoulders! I am a book listener and I have my book going whenever I am doing anything mindless. At home when I'm walking, treadmill, housework, cooking, folding laundry; commuting to and from work or driving anywhere; at work when I'm filing or sorting or waiting for a meeting to start or just running to the coffee room or the ladies'; shopping when I'm in the grocery store or the mall or - well - I use my IPod a LOT!And I turn them on and off, take them in and out and throw them across my shoulders like a stethoscope until I need them again. I have the extra length taken up with a little rubber cord gathering thingy. And because I ""wear"" my IPod almost constantly, they get tangled in my winter scarf, in my seatbelt, in my collar and I pull and tug and untangle. When my IPhone rings, I often pop the pods out of my IPod and stick them in my phone to improve the sound quality of the phone call. And when I'm done, pop them out and back into my IPod. Generally treat them with little care or gentleness.So, amortized at about $5/month for a really comfortable, easy to use, stays-put, delivers excellent sound set of earphones, I am not disappointed. I had another set already on the shelf. I kissed the dead ones goodbye and popped in the new ones and am happy again. (Note, the new ones are just ever so slightly larger than the old ones. It may take a little getting used to, but they seem to stay in OK, but I can feel the difference.)So now I'll buy a new backup pair and we'll see how long before I need those! Maybe I'll be just a teeny bit more gentle ... or not.I love the genuine Apple EarPod.",5.0,1,like earbuds lot wont bother cheap knockoffs apple earpods best ive ever owned ive owned something like different earphones new anatomical design excellent sooo comfortable usual apple innovates buds stay nicely snug ears comfortable without pressure without constant adjusting move work walk even run tend stay secure ears sound quality excellent mostly listen books buds little sibilance problems common earphones base tones rich strong sound nicely even dont keep adjusting volumethe nice thing buds outside sounds get nicely safetys sake family wont think youve completely tuned outthe thing remains seen well hold upmarch apple earpods midday today right earphone almost sound hear faint ive since early october coincidentally ordered means lasted months unhappy dont think soi use iphone ipad ipod use ipod lot almost always person usually tucked front pocket earbuds either ears draped shoulders book listener book going whenever anything mindless home im walking treadmill housework cooking folding laundry commuting work driving anywhere work im filing sorting waiting meeting start running coffee room ladies shopping im grocery store mall well use ipod lotand turn take throw across shoulders like stethoscope need extra length taken little rubber cord gathering thingy wear ipod almost constantly get tangled winter scarf seatbelt collar pull tug untangle iphone rings often pop pods ipod stick phone improve sound quality phone call im done pop back ipod generally treat little care gentlenessso amortized really comfortable easy use staysput delivers excellent sound set earphones disappointed another set already shelf kissed dead ones goodbye popped new ones happy note new ones ever slightly larger old ones may take little getting used seem stay ok feel differenceso ill buy new backup pair well see long need maybe ill teeny bit gentle noti love genuine apple earpod

1072,"Update July 10, 2014The EarPods were delivered and they appear to be OEM Apple; if they aren't I'd have no way of telling. They came packaged in a 2 1/2"" x 2 1/2"" plastic case with an Apple logo on the bottom. It looked very ""Apple.""The EarPods look and work exactly like my old ones - except these have volume buttons and a control button for pause/play and advance.I'm very happy with my purchase.Original review...I received a pair of Apple EarPods with the iPod Touch 5th gen I purchased September 2012. On those EarPods there is no microphone or buttons. They have worked well all 22 months, and I use them daily for between 1 and 5 hours each day. Finally the wires at the plug end of the cable are beginning to lose contact so I came here looking for a new pair.I was pleased to find these Apple OEM EarPods for only $17 (shipped) including the microphone and buttons. I expected to pay $29. I realize, from other user reviews, that the buttons won't work on my Samsung Galaxy S3 which is no big deal to me.Certainly the fit is dependent on ear shape. I do think Apple did their best to design a shape that will work well for the majority of purchasers. In my case they are very comfortable. I don't get tired of using them even after hours of use. They sound great but my most common use by far is not music so the sound quality isn't so critical.I must have 10 or more earbuds in the drawer. They all sit unused. I only wear the EarPods. I'm not an Apple fanboy. I did switch from Apple to Samsung/Android. But I give Apple credit for doing a good job of designing the EarPods. One thing I really like is there is nothing that can come apart - no silicone covers or such.My only concern at this point is I have not received this order yet. I hope what I receive are new Apple OEM EarPods and not some knockoff or refurbished pair. A few reviews have indicated they did not receive new Apple EarPods.I  I will tweak this review when I receive the EarPods.I highly recommend Apple EarPods.",5.0,1,update july earpods delivered appear oem apple arent id way telling came packaged x plastic case apple logo bottom looked applethe earpods look work exactly like old ones except volume buttons control button pauseplay advanceim happy purchaseoriginal reviewi received pair apple earpods ipod touch gen purchased september earpods microphone buttons worked well months use daily hours day finally wires plug end cable beginning lose contact came looking new pairi pleased find apple oem earpods shipped including microphone buttons expected pay realize user reviews buttons wont work samsung galaxy big deal mecertainly fit dependent ear shape think apple best design shape work well majority purchasers case comfortable dont get tired using even hours use sound great common use far music sound quality isnt criticali must earbuds drawer sit unused wear earpods im apple fanboy switch apple samsungandroid give apple credit good job designing earpods one thing really like nothing come apart silicone covers suchmy concern point received order yet hope receive new apple oem earpods knockoff refurbished pair reviews indicated receive new apple earpodsi tweak review receive earpodsi highly recommend apple earpods

1105,"These ear buds had two stages with my interest.They started out as one of my favorite ear buds I ever owned, then became one of my most hated ear buds (reasons below), then loved, then hated. I never really had a middle man for this things, probably due to my bias nature towards Apple.Now here is a quick summery of my upcoming review. The headphones are great, the audio quality is sharp, much better than their previous iteration, they are comfortable, the mic is solid, and it is a very nice pair of ear buds. However, the life span does not last long and the snug comfort suddenly became a ""fall out of my ear every 10 steps"" situation.Onto my situation with this product. The first time I bought these were around the time Apple had just announced them. I had my old apple ear buds and they lasted me at least a year with no major problems, aside from the wire exposure. I decided to upgrade to these new ones as they seemed like the solution to my big ears and ear buds refusing to stay in my ears. I got them about a week after I ordered them and instantly started using them for everyday life.They preformed magnificently and without issue. I would go on hikes with them, drive, walk, and just sit down and relax with them in my ear. It felt like nothing was in my ear but I could still ear music. I used them for 3 months with absolutely no issue.Suddenly, with a flip of a switch, they were dead. Literally dead. I could not play any music through them or get them to work. The change was so sudden that I thought it was my phone having issues with audio. I trouble shooted about my phone having audio issues for a while until I tested my older headphones and noticed they worked fine. I then realized it was my new ear buds that was the issue. I stated to trouble shoot the issue as well as try seeing what would be wrong with them. I messed with the wires, the inside of the ear buds, and the audio jack, but these things were dead, completely dead.This was a big let down as I really did love these but it just suddenly said, ""Nope, not today, not tomorrow, never again.""Fast forward about a year and a heavier use of headphones instead of ear buds, and I decided to go round 2 on these ear buds. I thought it may have been my treatment of the headphones, whole jogging and how I took them off, etc. This time around, I decided to have these for more light use such as walking through malls, sitting through classes or on the computer. While walking though, it was not as secure as the first set. The ear buds would fall out of my ears after almost any major movements, which was one of the most annoying things ever. However, it did not affect how well the ear buds were. Aside from them falling out of my ears, it worked like a charm and I had the love back. Then bam, it died. No warning, no buzz, clicks, or hiss sounds from them, just dead. This time, I was frustrated. I took even more time looking into them and if they would work again. I actually got the right side to work for a while, but it died later that day. That was roughly about a week ago this had happened and I do not plan to invest in a 3rd, I don't believe in 3rd times the charm.Now, I don't know if this is the real deal or just a REALLY good knock off, but if $30 ear buds crap out on me in under half a year, twice, that is my sign that these were not up to par, no matter how good they were while they lasted.",2.0,0,ear buds two stages interestthey started one favorite ear buds ever owned became one hated ear buds reasons loved hated never really middle man things probably due bias nature towards applenow quick summery upcoming review headphones great audio quality sharp much better previous iteration comfortable mic solid nice pair ear buds however life span last long snug comfort suddenly became fall ear every steps situationonto situation product first time bought around time apple announced old apple ear buds lasted least year major problems aside wire exposure decided upgrade new ones seemed like solution big ears ear buds refusing stay ears got week ordered instantly started using everyday lifethey preformed magnificently without issue would go hikes drive walk sit relax ear felt like nothing ear could still ear music used months absolutely issuesuddenly flip switch dead literally dead could play music get work change sudden thought phone issues audio trouble shooted phone audio issues tested older headphones noticed worked fine realized new ear buds issue stated trouble shoot issue well try seeing would wrong messed wires inside ear buds audio jack things dead completely deadthis big let really love suddenly said nope today tomorrow never againfast forward year heavier use headphones instead ear buds decided go round ear buds thought may treatment headphones whole jogging took etc time around decided light use walking malls sitting classes computer walking though secure first set ear buds would fall ears almost major movements one annoying things ever however affect well ear buds aside falling ears worked like charm love back bam died warning buzz clicks hiss sounds dead time frustrated took even time looking would work actually got right side work died later day roughly week ago happened plan invest dont believe times charmnow dont know real deal really good knock ear buds crap half year twice sign par matter good lasted

The Bose headphones are simply amazing and you'll fall in love with the sound. But first, you'll have to be okay with the price tag. I wasn't too excited about the price so I returned and purchased the new Earpods.I'm really glad I did! At first listen you can tell the difference between these and the previous version of Apple earphones. I feel the sound is very clear and adds the missing bass and mids. The plastic earpiece design is nice for easy cleaning of dirt or marks as they are transferred between listening sessions. I think the mic and volume controls have a nice feel to them when clicking between tracks or controlling the volume. The previous model felt a little tough on the click feedback. The new cord material is very nice and doesn't stick to clothing. Also, the cord is a little longer than previous model and you get a cool little, plastic case to keep them untangled.All in all, I'm pretty pleased on the build and sound quality. I mainly use them for hands free calling, music on the go and at the office. I use my Bose IE2 headphones when I want a bit more punch. There are definitely better over-ear and in-ear headphones out there but they are more pricey.

1179,"I hated Apple's previous generation of ear buds. Their sound quality was abysmal. But this new approach, while it somewhat resembles the old design, is a complete transformation. Though they rest in the outer parts of your ears and do not enter the ear canal, their tiny bass port magically conveys all the deep parts of music that the old ear buds were unable to. The result: all-day comfort, ability to hear what's going on around you, and music reproduction quality that rivals competitors costing two or three times as much.Plus, you've got that excellent microphone with touch controls for music playback and phone call management.I've gone through at least a half-dozen ear bud products for use with my iPhone and iPad, and am happy to report that Apple have finally applied their creativity to the weak link in their music playback chain.

That alone makes them well worth $25 to me (what I paid for it).The sound quality is very good in these. I won't attempt to say that they're comparable to Beats, Bose, or any other higher quality headphone, but they're by far the best pair that I've ever owned. The bass is surprisingly good, which is something you just don't usually get in headphones that are any less than $40 or $50.Sadly, the only feature of the microphone/buttons that works with my Samsung Galaxy S3 is pressing the middle button to answer phone calls (that's all it can do...once the call is answered, you can't actually speak into the mic), but that's not something I expected since my phone isn't an Apple.I recommend these to everyone who asks, because I'm very satisfied with the purchase.

1315,"Before I get into the review let me first state that I have tried several pair of headphones, many of them I hated, while only a select few I like. Im a big fan of the Klipsch brand. while I own a few different styles of the Beats headphones and earbuds.In no way shape or form are these the best ""sounding"" earbuds, but when you factor value in to them, their a sure winner.Apple did a great job desining these, I hate head phones that have the rubber tip that has to be dug deep into your ear drum, its just not comfortable enough for me, not to mention they always fall out. These on the other hand fit right on top of your ear, for me thats key! My ear isn't big, but it isn't small and even the headphones that came with multiple tips did me no justice.Equipped with this purchase is a small carrying case, allows your to wrap your headphones up and take them on the go without leaving them tangled or setting them up for a possible shortage.The build quality is the same as last years, the cord is very thin, and the actual Earpods themselves are made of the cheapest plastic, the speakers are decently built, you get a nice balance between actual vocal and bass, but still not on the level as some of the pricer earbuds.What apple did was attempt to change the Earbud category, by branding them with the name ""Earpods"", will see how effective it is, maybe they should offer up a different range of Earpods in the future, some more expensive kind, with better .build quality, I'd pay for that... Lets see if people walk into their local retail store and ask for ""Earpods"" as a general term...

Big mistake.  The retail package was unnecessarily difficult to open (in hindsight, I COULD have used that propane torch), they sound no better, in my opinion, than the old style, maybe even worse, don't stay put in my ears, and like all earbuds require a hard (plugged in) connection to a device, and tangle endlessly.In addition, the storage unit provided by Apple is a real nuisance to use, worthwhile only for long-term storage; no wonder there's an aftermarket for different styles.While earbuds can be handy portability-wise, the older-style Apple earbuds with microphone would seem to be a better and less expensive (ten bucks on Amazon) choice if you really want Apple earbuds.

1344,"I think rating a product like headphones, speakers or ear buds is a highly subjective thing. What works for you may not work for you (and vice versa).I have several sets of Apple ear buds which came with an iPod and an iPad. I didn't like them because they didn't fit in my ear properly. This caused them to perform poorly in terms of the audio quality and convenience.  They wouldn't stay in my ears.  I gave them to my kids to use, lose and destroy.The only ear buds I've been 'happy' with have been the in-ear type that have the soft silicone rubber things that make them fit snugly in your ear canal.  This improved the sound quality immensely but having something jammed inside my ear for long periods caused comfort problems.When I saw the new Ear Pods, I thought they would be something which would work well for me because of the way they are designed.  Ear bud purchases are a crap shoot because you can't really try them before you buy. A pair came with my kids' new iPods, I tried them and I was pleased. I bought some.The remote volume and iPod controls are a welcome addition.  I don't have an iPhone so I can't speak to the mic's performance.  I always hate sitting at my desk and fumbling for the pause button on my iPod when someone sneaks up on me and taps my shoulder. I only wish it were lower on the cord rather than near my chin.

You press the one on top to turn the volume up and the one on the bottom to turn the volume down. If you hold down the middle button, it will control Siri. I would highly recommend these earphones. The only downside is if you are putting them in a Windows computer, the microphone or the control on the cord will not work.

However, they do hurt my ears after an hour of wear. Granted, this probably won't be a problem for everyone.  I have smaller ears so generally hard earbuds are not that comfortable for me. I do warrant this as a 2 star deduction because they were advertised ""to rest comfortably"" and ""more comfortable for more people than any other earbud-style headphone,"" which certainly was not the case for me.

1463,"I got the EarPods with my iP5.  I have a set of the original Apple ear buds that came with my iP3GS but never bothered trying them.These EarPods sound reasonable on their own, but mids are lacking and treble is a bit bright and harsh.  Not bad for the price, I guess, and definitely great for a freebie with many i-products.Enter the Dirac DSP app.  Dirac uses DSP (Digital Signal Processing) to emphasise the frequencies where the EarPods are lacking and to tone down and control the areas where they are harsh, flattening and smoothing the sound.  The result is a night-and-day transformation of the sound quality from the EarPods; they go from sounding ""acceptable"" to sounding REALLY good.  Treble frequencies go from irritating to downright pleasant, the mids and mid-bass fill in and warm up beautifully, and the bass seems to get a bit more authority without becoming distracting.If I have any criticism at all of the sound of the Dirac enhanced 'Pods, it would be that the sound balance is still just a touch bright (too much treble) for my taste, but this is a highly subjective comment and everyone will have their own preference.  With that said, I would still rate their sound a solid 9.5/10 with half a point pulled for the treble emphasis (once again, based on my personal preference only).Regarding sub-bass, these 'Pods are solid down to 40 Hz which is enough to enjoy most music fully, and the output tapers off below 40.  By 30 Hz there's not much going on, and below 30 Hz is basically missing.  Please don't read into this too much; these are non-isolating in-ear phones and as such have GREAT bass...  asking more from a design like this is probably asking too much.  The Dirac app seems to bolster the low end slightly, but the EarPods are not really lacking in bass to begin with.The Dirac player is available in the iTunes store.  The FREE version is great to try out, and lets you navigate your library easily.  For $3 the full version allows you to use your playlists and is very functional; I see no real disadvantage vs. the built in player in the iPhone.  Battery life using the Dirac player seems good, roughly the same as using the built in player.  There's also a setting that allows you to select optimization for the EarPods OR the original Apple ear buds (I haven't tried it with the originals).As far as fit and function of the EarPods goes, no complaints.  I find them comfortable and they seem to stay put reasonably well.  They don't fit very snug so I just have to trust that they will stay in place, and the weight of the cord seems to be enough to make them stay put.  One thing to note for those of you in colder climates who wear ear muffs; the ""stem"" on the back of the 'Pods is quite long and interferes with my 180's muffs a bit, making them slightly uncomfortable.  The 180's are very thin and press your ears to your head so this is not surprising and may be an issue with other in-ear phones as well.  I have not tried other types of ear muffs that may offer more room inside and interfere less.Overall I'm very pleased with the EarPods/Dirac combo.  I like their non-isolating, easy wearing design and find them perfect for wearing at work where long periods of use don't cause discomfort and I can easily hear what's going on around me (and a quick tap on the center of the remote pauses the music).  For home use I have a set of far more expensive full size over-the-ears Beyerdynamic DT-770's that, with a little EQ tweaking, I prefer overall to the Dirac'd EarPods.  But considering the cost of the 'Pods (free for many people) and the $3 cost of the Dirac player app, this is an unquestionable home run.",4.0,1,got earpods set original apple ear buds came never bothered trying themthese earpods sound reasonable mids lacking treble bit bright harsh bad price guess definitely great freebie many iproductsenter dirac dsp app dirac uses dsp digital signal processing emphasise frequencies earpods lacking tone control areas harsh flattening smoothing sound result nightandday transformation sound quality earpods go sounding acceptable sounding really good treble frequencies go irritating downright pleasant mids midbass fill warm beautifully bass seems get bit authority without becoming distractingif criticism sound dirac enhanced pods would sound balance still touch bright much treble taste highly subjective comment everyone preference said would still rate sound solid half point pulled treble emphasis based personal preference onlyregarding subbass pods solid hz enough enjoy music fully output tapers hz theres much going hz basically missing please dont read much nonisolating inear phones great bass asking design like probably asking much dirac app seems bolster low end slightly earpods really lacking bass begin withthe dirac player available itunes store free version great try lets navigate library easily full version allows use playlists functional see real disadvantage vs built player iphone battery life using dirac player seems good roughly using built player theres also setting allows select optimization earpods original apple ear buds havent tried originalsas far fit function earpods goes complaints find comfortable seem stay put reasonably well dont fit snug trust stay place weight cord seems enough make stay put one thing note colder climates wear ear muffs stem back pods quite long interferes muffs bit making slightly uncomfortable thin press ears head surprising may issue inear phones well tried types ear muffs may offer room inside interfere lessoverall im pleased earpodsdirac combo like nonisolating easy wearing design find perfect wearing work long periods use dont cause discomfort easily hear whats going around quick tap center remote pauses music home use set far expensive full size overtheears beyerdynamic little eq tweaking prefer overall diracd earpods considering cost pods free many people cost dirac player app unquestionable home run

1478,"I agree with some of the reviewers. I lost the excellent Apple earphones that came with my iPhone 4S and bought a new pair of earPods from the Apple Store (1/2014), the only model available, and ended up returning them a few days later. They are smaller than the roundish earphones Apple used to ship with iPhone, iPod a couple of years back and they simply did not stay in my ears. They kept falling at the slightest movement (which is bound to happen while walking or moving, unless you lay on your bed listening to music). Yes, they look cool and hip with a design that looks like it came from a wind tunnel, that said, now, the earbuds are so smooth that there are no ""edges"" that keep them in place.Instead, I bought a knock off of the old ones from eBay for a fraction of the price and couldn't be happier with the fit and the sound of the old earphones. I love you Apple but this is a miss, at least for me. I am writing this review to counterbalance the 4 stars given so far, so that potential buyers are aware this could be a problem for a few ears.About the box - The earPods come in a nice white Apple plastic box that could have been used as regular storage when you remove your earphones. However I can tell that box is simply for presentation (the first time you take your earphones out), and not for subsequent everyday use. I think it's a shame and another miss from Apple.What I mean by that is that when I packed the earphones back in the box, to return them to the Apple Store, the box only has enough space (to the mm) to fit the wire around and each earphone, volume control have to lay in their own, perfectly carved space. So, if you wanted to use that box as everyday storage (instead of leaving them loose in your pocket), you would need to take time to careful wrap the earphones back in the box. It would have been great to use that nice little box on a daily basis to wrap the earphones loosely/carelessly in 15 seconds or less. The box did not affect my 1-star rating, of course, but its just an example that precision engineering does not always translate to the most practical products.",1.0,0,agree reviewers lost excellent apple earphones came iphone bought new pair earpods apple store model available ended returning days later smaller roundish earphones apple used ship iphone ipod couple years back simply stay ears kept falling slightest movement bound happen walking moving unless lay bed listening music yes look cool hip design looks like came wind tunnel said earbuds smooth edges keep placeinstead bought knock old ones ebay fraction price couldnt happier fit sound old earphones love apple miss least writing review counterbalance stars given far potential buyers aware could problem earsabout box earpods come nice white apple plastic box could used regular storage remove earphones however tell box simply presentation first time take earphones subsequent everyday use think shame another miss applewhat mean packed earphones back box return apple store box enough space mm fit wire around earphone volume control lay perfectly carved space wanted use box everyday storage instead leaving loose pocket would need take time careful wrap earphones back box would great use nice little box daily basis wrap earphones looselycarelessly seconds less box affect rating course example precision engineering always translate practical products

Most earbuds don't fit properly, the only one's I've used that fit are in the ear types. Those can cause pain after a while. These sit in my ears without being plugged in to the ear cannel. They are very comfortable and the sound is incredible. The first song I played was one with a both a strong brass line and a very light and subtle woodwind/percussion melody. The horns came out strong and cutting, while the percussion and woodwinds were very bouncy and delicate.  I switched over to some ambient, new age music and the same. The melody was very delicate and I could hear everything nicely. Any earbuds better are going to cost significantly more than these. They are definitely a keeper.My only con is like most Apple ear buds, they never go back into the package as well as they come out. There must be a secret to getting them back in correctly. No matter how I try the plug always ends up in a corner instead of the middle.

1625,"I've owned a number of different headphones/earbuds and can tell you which lasted longest, which took the biggest beating, which were most comfortable, etc.I'll start off with these being far better than the previous headphones issued by apple over the years.  For me, they're probably the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned.  But there's a lot revolving around that statement.  For one, everyone's ears are different.  I like these specifically because with noise canceling earbuds, you tend to either lose the silicone/rubbed seals, or cannot find one that properly fits and stays in your ear.  They have a nice sound for what it's worth and easily replaceable if necessary.For example, I take these to the gym with me, rather than my Klipsch x10's for obvious reasons.  When running or moving a lot, the seal tends to break and one ear will feel louder than the other.  Having to keep readjusting is fairly annoying.  I don't take my Bose headphones for the same reason.(plus the cost difference of having to replace either, when these particular Apple earbuds are very cheap by comparison.)When it's all said and done, it's a matter of preference and if they actually fit your particular ear.  Before buying, try out a pair of a friends or perhaps at an apple store.  I can (although I do not) wear these for hours on end without any issue.  Unlike..  Cheap ""gummy"" headphones.  Which I actually cringe when removing them after wearing them for 30 minutes.  The pain isn't even worth it.  But at the same time some people an wear them for hours.

I almost got excited when my current headphones started going out, so i ordered these. All the reviews i had read were leading me to believe that these were awesome.

I though maybe this was just my ears but after research found that this is the intent. So they are loose in my ear which always gives me the feeling that people around me can hear everything playing through it, even though i was assured they cannot. When i put them in and press down so that they are snug against my ear, the reviews were correct the bass and sound was much better. However when they are simply in your ear there is almost no bass at all, the sound isnt bad however it just sounds like a stereo blasting with full trebble and no bass so it is kind of irritating. As far as comfort goes at first it is nice, but then like all other headphones you feel the need to take them out after about 30 minutes. Not to mention that the loose fit gives you the feeling that they are always about to fall out. If i had a spare set to last me i would return them right away, not that they are horrible non working headphones. I would just rather have a pair of skull candy headphones that fit snug in my ear and sound fantastic for half the price.

1711,"I like the way music sounds through Apple's ear-pods, which is why I always rebuy them [from Target or Wal-Mart] when they break (which is every month for me). I don't abuse my ear-pods, nor do I use them religiously, but the side with the remote on it always seems to die on me.I had my worst experience with these ear-pods yesterday, when-for absolutely NO reason may I add-the jack of the product broke in the port of my iPod. The broken jack piece was way too small to take out easily; I struggled with it for hours. And eventually I pulled it out! Just kidding, I pulled out yet another broke piece of the already broken jack that was stuck in my iPod. I wasn't being rough with it while trying to pull it out but the jack seemed to be falling apart in my iPod. I freaked out about it and was sure my I would need to replace my iPod port by the end of all of this, but my dad (who is an electrical engineer) managed to safely take the jack piece out without ruining my iPod.I will NEVER NEVER NEVER buy Apple ear-pods again. I wouldn't buy them (or plug them into any ports on my electronics) if they were the only ear-pods in the world.Sure they sound good for a little bit, but seriously, don't waste your money. I would recommend Sony's ear-phones (which are btw 1/2 the price of Apple's ear-pods).If I wasn't so sure this incident was NOT a result of me being rough with the ear-pods I wouldn't be writing this review.

1737,"Sound - For $30 the sound quality is excellent. I have read some reviews of poor bass but this just is not the case. Sure there are others out there with more bass, but for those that like an equal balance of sound, you will be happy. The sound is literally shot down your ear canal and makes for great quality without having to adjust the headphones to get that sweet-spot. I used to have to play with my headphones and move them around in my ear until the sound was just right. No more!Fit - I have also read many reviews that say the earbuds won't stay in their ears. Perhaps these reviewers have odd shaped ear canals (not trying to make fun of anyone... there are a lot of different sizes and shapes out there). That is the only explanation I can find for a negative review on the fit of these earbuds. I am literally sitting here at my computer violently shaking my head in every direction trying to shake these things out of my ears. But they won't fall out! Seriously, these things act like they WANT to stay in your ears.Comfort - I haven't noticed any discomfort with these earbuds in my ears. They are a new shape compared to my last pair of headphones, but they are very comfortable and I soon forget they are even there. One important note: I have noticed that when listening to music at high volumes, my ears will ache from the sound. I blame this on the fact that the earbuds are aiming all of that sound directly into my ear canal. My advice is to be extra careful with not blowing out your eardrums. If you notice your ears bleeding (I am referring to a review I read here on amazon)... well that's a pretty good sign that your music is too loud!Durability - If you have owned apple headphones before, these seem to be on par with their build quality, perhaps a little better. The volume control/remote/speaker is slightly bigger and more solid feeling than the previous apple headphones w/mic. Overall, these things are made to handle everyday life but would not hold up well under extreme conditions of any kind.Overall - I am very pleased with these headphones. For the price they offer excellent sound. The way in which they aim the sound down the ear canal is revolutionary in design. This feature alone, in my opinion, places the apple earbuds above any other pair of headphones in this price range. The only downside I can see is the fact that every buyer is taking a risk when purchasing these earbuds. If the shape of their ear is out of the ordinary, these earbuds may be uncomfortable and/or fall out easily. I took the risk and found them to be a perfect fit.

1759,"Since the original ear buds were pretty much worthless to me (uncomfortable, poor sound) I was somewhat skeptical of the ear pods. When I got my iPhone 5 and tried out the ear pods, I immediately noticed that these were a whole different product.COMFORT: EXCELLENTThese are comfy headphones. I have been using a pair of Klipsch in-ear headphones for over two years. Unlike the Klipsch and other headphones, these don't actually insert into your ear canal. I figured this would make them similar to the old ear phones that hurt after a very short time but that isn't the case. They sort of just sit comfortably in your ear. They don't need to be pushed in, they fit well and aren't loose and they don' wear on you after an hour or two. They just feel nice and are hardly noticeable, even after four or five hours of use. These are comfortable headphones.SOUND QUALITY: GOODThe design of the ear pods is such that they pack a good amount of quality sound in a small package and without having to cover your ears and without being inserted into your ear canal. The bass on these headphones is actually pretty good. I've had Sennheiser headphones, Bose Triports and others and these aren't as good as those but they're really decent for the size and form factor.FEATURES: AWESOMEOne of my favorite aspects of the ear pods is that I can talk, turn up the volume, turn down the volume, pause my music/Pandora/audiobook/podcast/video and resume my media all without taking the iPhone out of my pocket. That's pretty awesome. The microphone picks up my voice just fine, the volume and action buttons are responsive and extremely useful. These features alone really give the ear pods a huge advantage over the competition, especially if you're using them with an Apple product. I haven't tried them with my iPad 3 yet but I assume they work the same on that.SIZE/CORD: GREATThe size of the ear phones themselves seems great to me. The cord doesn't tangle easily and isn't too long or too short. No complaints here.SUMMARYThis is a pretty wonderful little set of headphones. I was completely uninterested in them when I got my phone. I'm so pleasantly surprised at what a nice addition these are to the iPhone.

1820,"So, when Apple made the wild claims about the quality of a $39 pair of headphones, I was quite sceptical.  But the moment you open these things up, you realize something special was going on here.  Before I go any further, I should also point out I've owned countless headphones varying in price from $10 to $450.  I have an ear for quality, and have formal training as a sound designer.  When apple claimed that these headphones had better bass response than most headphones on the market at any price, I thought it was impossible.  Now, while these don't have the bass response of say some Beats By Dr Dre, they have better bass response than any headphones under $100 I've ever heard.  The sound is clean and natural.  The bass is tight and accurate, not booming and overbearing like other bass heavy headphones.  I was shocked at how much bass response a pair of headphones this cheap actually can have.  The shape of the headphones, is brilliant in that they sit comfortably without feeling as though they are going to fall out of your ears.  The Volume and home button controls are in a great place, the perfect distance from your ears.  Sure, I wish these would come in black, because the only things white I own are apple products, but none the less, I still want black cables!  Hence the 4 star review.  I highly recommend these to anybody not willing to spend $200 or more on headphones to get some high end stuff.  These will beat the majority of products priced less.",4.0,1,apple made wild claims quality pair headphones quite sceptical moment open things realize something special going go also point ive owned countless headphones varying price ear quality formal training sound designer apple claimed headphones better bass response headphones market price thought impossible dont bass response say beats dr dre better bass response headphones ive ever heard sound clean natural bass tight accurate booming overbearing like bass heavy headphones shocked much bass response pair headphones cheap actually shape headphones brilliant sit comfortably without feeling though going fall ears volume home button controls great place perfect distance ears sure wish would come black things white apple products none less still want black cables hence star review highly recommend anybody willing spend headphones get high end stuff beat majority products priced less

Unfortunately, once the pretty package was opened and I managed to parse which of the elegantly silk-screened headphones were meant for which ear, the news was almost all bad.Fit: Unlike most current earbuds, these are meant to sit loosely on the outer part of the ear canal, where their side-porting design can operate. The fit is loose and uncertain as a result, with minimal blockage of outside noise. It also requires a higher volume setting as a result. Not really a problem, but worth noting if you routinely switch between car and headphones.Sound: No getting around it--it's bass-heavy, muddy, and indistinct. Unlike many other reviewers, I've so far made no efforts to EQ around it (if I did, I'd be signing up for a ton of headaches as I switched my phone to different output systems throughout the day). Using standard settings, midrange is just passable, highs are tinny, and bass is overwhelming, fuzzy, and congested. The best I can describe the sound is that it's exactly the same as when you're on an airplane which is switching altitude and your ears haven't ""popped"" yet.Bottom line: Moments after putting them on, I was regretting the purchase.  Hours of listening later hasn't warmed my opinion of them. Next time, I'll try to remember to pack a better pair of headphones when I travel.

These aren't noise isolating (nor should they be); perfect for the commuter.

Like Beats headphones, if you listen to R&B; and other music where big, boomy bass is what you want, you won't notice the issue. If you tend to listen to rock, you'll find the bass sounds sloppy and can't keep up with the speed of the song -- the driver is just too large to pump out quick, short notes. And while another reviewer suggested using Bass Reducer in the EQ settings, this is to the individual -- for me, the EQ settings are so hidden it's a royal pain to adjust them every time I swap between headphones/car stereo, and beyond that, if headphones are so poorly balanced that I need to do such a thing, I shouldn't be wearing them. Your Mileage May Vary.The good news: They don't create a seal in the ear, so pedestrians wearing them can still hear things like car horns and busses while crossing the street.The bad news: They don't create a seal in the ear, so those of us riding the buses still have to listen to the sound that leaks from your headphones.I admit that working at Big Box Retailer Central and having an employee discount on headphones has me completely lost as to what retail price is for most pairs, so whether it's possible to find better ones with the remote and microphone for $30, I don't know.

I looked at pictures and diagrams to see just how, exactly, I was supposed to insert them, but I discovered only that I was, indeed, doing it right... They just wouldn't fit.Back when Apple used to supply the little foam covers for their ear buds, I would use them until they wore out because they were the only way I could fit the buds in my ears and be assured that they would stay in. I'd find replacement covers wherever I could find them to keep them nestled safely in my ears.So I tried using a pair of those foam covers, and after struggling to get them on the pods, I tried them out.  They still don't fit so well, but at least they don't slip out.

1932,"I'm reviewing the ones that came with my brand new iPhone 5 (so they're genuine). I'm an audio enthusiast, and I've tried many headphones/earphones but I must say that I am surprised that they were able to get this much bass out of an earbud design (where it doesn't form a seal in your ear canal). The benefit of this is that it doesn't block as much background noise so that you can still hear your surroundings depending on how loud you have your music but the downside is that low/deep bass is pretty much absent. I greatly value bass, so this is unacceptable to me but for what they are (""free"" item that comes with your phone), they're great.I recommend auditioning the Ultimate Ears 500 earphones. I purchased over 10 pairs of earphones/headphones including the Klipsch IMAGE S4, Ultimate Ears 600vi, Beyerdynamic MMX 101 iE, MEElectronics M9-SL, MEElectronics SP51-BK, Sony MDREX310LP, JVC HAFX1X Xtreme-Xplosivs, Sony MDR-XB700, JVC HARX900, Bose Quiet Comfort 15 models before deciding that I had hit the jackpot with the UE500s.

1933,"As a new owner of the EarPods, I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised by what Apple accomplished with a earbud headphone.It's VASTLY better than the old Apple earbuds, that's to be sure--bass and midrange is surprisingly good, and efficiency is not bad--it only needs a tad more volume level to equal the volume levels I get with my Klipsch Image S4i in-ear headphones.Best of all, the price is reasonable: US$29, not much more than the ""cheap"" in-ear headphones you see at many places. And it has the in-line controller that works with recent-production iPods, all models of the iPhone, and all models of the iPad.In short, Apple has a major winner on its hands.",5.0,1,new owner earpods say pleasantly surprised apple accomplished earbud headphoneits vastly better old apple earbuds thats surebass midrange surprisingly good efficiency badit needs tad volume level equal volume levels get klipsch image inear headphonesbest price reasonable much cheap inear headphones see many places inline controller works recentproduction ipods models iphone models ipadin short apple major winner hands

1951,"I bought a set of these ""new"" ear buds to go w/ my 4th gen iPod Touch.  The original ear buds never did work for me as they would always slip out of my ear after a minute or so of putting them in place.  When I saw the new design/shape of theses ear buds I was pleased to see that someone at Apple had consulted a physiologist or at least looked at a person w/ an actual ear and noticed that most human ears are NOT in fact perfectly round!I was able to place these ear buds in my ear and wear them comfortably for several hours while sitting at my desk at work or even taking a leisurely stroll around the block.  The microphone and all of the volume/music controls worked great w/ video chat apps like Face Time and Skype and also Pandora and Rhapsody.  Sound response was generally good w/ a slight bias toward treble it seems but nothing unbearable.Things were going so well w/ these ear buds so I decided to try them out on my daily four mile tread mill run which typically takes about 40 - 45 mins.  I perspire heavily when I work out and no ear buds have ever been able to stay put when I work out but these buds had done well where others had not so I though I'd give them a try.  Unfortunately about 15 mins into my run they started to slip out and I would have to press them back in about every 30 secs or so and then about 25 mins in the left one stopped working all together unfortunately!  It would seem that the foam padded over the ear headphones I got at Target for $18.99 are still the best option for my work outs.At first I thought it was probably an adverse affect of the moisture so I let them dry over night next to the mildly warm air that comes from fan vent on my laptop but that was to no avail.  The next day the left ear bud was still unresponsive.  I may try to return to the Apple store as I've only had them a few months but I'm not very hopeful on that front.In spite of this issue I am still giving this product three stars b/c my assumption is they would have lasted indefinitely had I not used them outside of their comfort zone.

1968,"Summary: These headphones aren't the worst or best.  They lean more towards the worst, but are WAY better than the old Apple earbuds. EarPods are great for switching between iPhone music apps/mp3s and phone calls!Bottom Line: Apple EarPods are a perfect compromise (for me) of decent audio quality headphones that won't break the bank if I have to replace them along with the functional usage of a remote/mic combo.I own:Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones,Shure E4c Sound Isolating Earphones,Sennheiser HD555 Professional Headphones with Sound Channeling, Sennheiser 485 headphones, andAllen & Heath Xone:XD-40 Professional Monitoring Headphones.  These cover the spectrum of entry-level and mid-level audiophile headphones.  The Shures are great because they create a seal with memory-foam-like material in your ear canal - perfect for airplanes because you don't hear anything but music/movies. Sennheiser and Xone headphones are just good... they are like a good set of speakers on a mid to high level home audio system. These headphones are a million times better than Apple EarPods.However...The problem with audiophile quality headphones is that you pretty much have to listen to everything uncompressed to enjoy them. MP3s reveal too many imperfections because they are compressed data.  On my iPhone, I need headphones for stuff like Pandora, Youtube, Hulu, Netflix, and mp3s... music/sound that isn't true to form because of compression. The expensive headphones I listed are overkill for those uses. The less expensive ones: Xones, Shure e2cs, and Sennheiser 485 (discontinued and not available on Amazon) kick major tail for iPhone audio sources. So what's the drawback of these headphones?I hate jamming stuff into my ear (Shures) and all the headphones I just listed are too expensive/cumbersome for me to bring just anywhere. The Sennheiser 555 and Shure e4s need an amp ... not liking the idea of being tethered to a portable amp (I have one but it's just a hassle sometimes to carry around).Why I wanted these: The EarPods have the added functionality of a remote/mic combo.Of note: I wouldn't recommend these for usage in noisy places like airplanes and subway trains because these leak sound in.

1975,These are great little ear phones for price. They are genuine Apple Ear Pods. The mic picks up very well; meaning you don't have to talk loud to be heard. You can also control the volume and pause play functions on iPhones/iPods. I sleep with mine in and they tend to stay in. Some people may have problems with that based on their anatomy or if they are a restless sleeper. I shouldn't review the fidelity of them since me ears were damaged by noise in the military. But that being said for me they sound great; and no I don't have to play them really loud. They give good results even at low volumes. Something important about these is that Apple seems to have fixed the insulation; the old ear buds used to stiffen up; which is probably a reaction to skin oils. I've used this model for over a year and haven't seen any of that old problem. I'm hard on mine so I bought two this time; and when I finally break these I'm buy them again.

1976,"A bit of a background:I have a pair of Sennheiser HD280 pros, a pair of Bose QC's, and up until recently a five year old pair of iPod ear buds.I posted over 1,000 running miles on my trusty old ear buds using the Nike Plus system.  I ran through snow, rain, freezing rain, and wind.  And yes - they even saw a wash/dry cycle or two.  I hated to see them go.After my initial impressions with the earPods, this is my review.Before leaving the house, I compared them sound-wise to an old set of ear buds and my Sennheisers just for laughs.The sound quality is far better on the earPods than the old earBuds, *especially* the bass.  The earPod's response is certainly not ""flat"" sounding, but it does have a multidimensional quality that the earBuds lack.  The sound quality isn't directly comparable to the Sennheisers, but those are over the ear DJ phones at 3x the price.Now, for the running.After mile 2 they started hurting my ears a bit.  I fiddled with them and they got better.  I found I didn't need to rotate them upwards as much for them to stay seated.  I was OK again by mile 3.  They do not fit me like the buds did, so it took some getting used to.  They do lock into place and they don't move.  It was cold, so I didn't sweat very much.  They have to stay in when I sweat - that is an absolute requirement.  I'm going to assume they would be OK based on how well they seated.  They are overall a bit better with not shifting around than the old buds were.Sound-wise, I was simply astounded.  There is no comparison in sound quality of the pods and buds once you get out into the world.  The pods did an amazing job with traffic and cross-winds.  The sound from the pods really cut through, especially support instruments and other sounds not normally ""up front"".  The old buds would get a very washed out sound while running with most background sounds.  Only down an empty dirt road with no wind would the old buds really give you a decent listening experience.  The pods and the buds are not sound blocking devices: you can still hear traffic, but the difference is you can also hear the music and the traffic, not just the traffic.Upon returning I inspected them.  The reason for the ""owie"" is there is a sharp oval edge on the forward pointing part of the device.  They cut into my ear a little bit.  They should look at rounding those off a bit.One more thing to point out - the remote is perfect for adjusting sound.  The sound wheel doesn't work with gloves on, and it can be quite touchy while running, making it difficult to adjust.  The up-down volume next to the ear is perfect.  Now I can hide the iPod away and not mess with it for the whole run.",5.0,1,bit backgroundi pair sennheiser pros pair bose qcs recently five year old pair ipod ear budsi posted running miles trusty old ear buds using nike plus system ran snow rain freezing rain wind yes even saw washdry cycle two hated see goafter initial impressions earpods reviewbefore leaving house compared soundwise old set ear buds sennheisers laughsthe sound quality far better earpods old earbuds especially bass earpods response certainly flat sounding multidimensional quality earbuds lack sound quality isnt directly comparable sennheisers ear dj phones pricenow runningafter mile started hurting ears bit fiddled got better found didnt need rotate upwards much stay seated ok mile fit like buds took getting used lock place dont move cold didnt sweat much stay sweat absolute requirement im going assume would ok based well seated overall bit better shifting around old buds weresoundwise simply astounded comparison sound quality pods buds get world pods amazing job traffic crosswinds sound pods really cut especially support instruments sounds normally front old buds would get washed sound running background sounds empty dirt road wind would old buds really give decent listening experience pods buds sound blocking devices still hear traffic difference also hear music traffic trafficupon returning inspected reason owie sharp oval edge forward pointing part device cut ear little bit look rounding bitone thing point remote perfect adjusting sound sound wheel doesnt work gloves quite touchy running making difficult adjust updown volume next ear perfect hide ipod away mess whole run

I've bought other brands, most recently Bose's IE2s (for 2-1/2 times the Price of these Apple Earpods), which deliver much better than good sound but they always feel like they're about to fall out. These Apple buds fit beautifully and they are an ""in-canal"" fit so you feel that they're in solidly while they don't wear you out after a few hours.The microphone/volume/everything-else-having-to-do-with-an-Iphone control on the right wire allows you to fool with your Ipod/Iphone without having to take it out of your pocket. (Since I don't own an Iphone I will not further comment on that feature.But, as a serious - and constant - listener to classical music as well as other genres, I am VERY impressed with the sound quality above all. These buds are designed without any need for those stupid rubber ""gaskets"" which always get lost.I am hopeful these Earpods will hold up over time. If they do, they will be one of the best 29 dollar investments I've made in a long time.

1978,I was wowed the instant I hit play with these Earpods in.  The sound is many times better than the prior iPhone earbuds. The bass jumps out at you but is not annoying or overwhelming. The mids and highs are well represented and do not irritate after listening for a while.  Perhaps most importantly they simply fit.  No repositioning or cramming in the ear necessary.  Slip them in and listen.  You will hardly know they are there.

2035,"I'm a very picky person when it comes to ear buds. I find the less expensive ones painful, and the noise canceling ones too intrusive. Apple Ipod ear buds have always been my mainstay for quality and comfort, so giving these a try seemed like a good idea. Turns out it was a GREAT idea. I have never gotten such sound quality from ear buds before. They compare themselves to higher priced ear buds, and I now believe they are justified in doing so. I would highly recommend these to anyone for themselves, or as a gift to someone who loves their music. The only reason these didn't earn a 5 is due to the mic not being recognized for use with my computer. The mic was an incentive I wanted with my purchase, but unfortunately, I haven't been able to find out what it actually works with. That being said, it was only a side function. The last point, comfort, was also well addressed in the designing of these ear buds. They ergonomically fit into the large area of your ear without a loss of sound quality. Simply wonderful.",4.0,1,im picky person comes ear buds find less expensive ones painful noise canceling ones intrusive apple ipod ear buds always mainstay quality comfort giving try seemed like good idea turns great idea never gotten sound quality ear buds compare higher priced ear buds believe justified would highly recommend anyone gift someone loves music reason didnt earn due mic recognized use computer mic incentive wanted purchase unfortunately havent able find actually works said side function last point comfort also well addressed designing ear buds ergonomically fit large area ear without loss sound quality simply wonderful

These are uniquely designed to easily slip into one's ear without a fuss, to be super comfortable and to fit in anyone's ear regardless of their size.

2262,"These are by far the best earphones I have ever bought. I am a person with strange ears and I have never found a pair of earphones that actually fit and stayed in my ear. These, however, are completely different and comfortably sit in my ear without me ever having to push them back in. This resting inside of your ear also helps reduce pain if worn for many hours. They do not go deep into you ear, as they sit just behind the cartilage above your earlobe.The audio quality of them is superb. They never struggle with any pitch, and have especially excellent bass. Another nice thing is they don't ""plug up"" your ears, meaning they don't completely block up your ear canal and give you that feeling when you want your ears to pop.To recap, here are some of the pros and cons:Pros:Very good fit inside your earsExcellent sound qualityGreat price (trust me, it is.)Stylish and lightRemote and mic work brilliantly (you can even pause and replay YouTube videos!)Very durableCons:Wire is a little bit shortSometimes hard to put back into carrying caseOverall, these are the best earphones I have ever owned, and I strongly recommend them to everyone.

2263,"I did have high expectations for these earbuds, or as apple calls them ""Earpods"", but to be honest they really aren't anything special. I like them, but I can't see much of a difference between them and the old apple earbuds, and honestly the old earbuds actually stayed in my ear a whole lot better then these do.The way these work is that the ""pod"" is supposed to fit into your ear and allow a much richer sound then the old ones because the speaker goes further into the drum, without actually going INTO the drum or canal of the ear like other products do. Now I'm no audiophile in the least so I can't say this provides rich bass and high highs and all that stuff, but music does sound GOOD through these pods...but I don't think it's anything more then what the old pods used to give.Apple states that they have found a good fit for most ears, by doing many ear molds of many people. For myself personally, they barely fit and I can keep them in for awhile and not have any issues, but if I adjust my head position just a bit they'll dislodge and will sound weird until I reposition the pod. I've seen on here though that many people get pains in their ears after awhile and I haven't noticed any of that with my experience, only that they will fall out fairly easily. The thing I like about them is that there isn't any piece of rubber that's eventually going to wear and fall off like the old buds, but when the buds had that rubber on them it fit very well (in my case at least).Another issue is, is that these fit flush with the inside of the ear, so it feels weird to have one pod out and have the other pod in. Also you can't eat comfortably with these in because if you are munching on something it will vibrate in the ear and...well it's just a weird feeling and experience. I need to be able to have one pod in and another out when I take the train, sometimes they change what platform the train is coming in on and announce it, and I have to listen to the announcements for this purpose. This causes me to just turn off my music completely and pack them away when I get to my station.I've also used these to talk to people and from what I've noticed people can hear me just fine and I can hear them fine as well. The mic works and allows me to hang up on people or end calls and also has other functions that will work with apple phones (fast forward, rewind, etc just read the directions on the package sent).My recommendation is to buy the old earbuds. They sell on Amazon for like a dollar or two with prime shipping so when the rubber does eventually fall apart just buy another one, or maybe even buy a few of them. I don't think these are worth the price I paid (almost 30 dollars) and I'm glad I had an Amazon coupon when I got them, because I'd be pretty upset if I spent full price on them. I'm going to keep these because I've stuck them in my ear and dirtied them up so it would be unacceptable for me to send them back, but for all those people that really want to know about these earpods, I personally don't think they are worth it. Perhaps they'll be a better fit for you and they won't fall out as easily as they do for me.*Edit*So I officially need to lower this another star. I find that the left earbud fits perfectly, with no troubles, wobbles, or looseness, but the right earbud will fall out...and it actually did completely fall out when I was working out the other day.

It is an insane torture to wear these, empirically so theyre utter junk, too short, wont stay in (silicone is needed for this, as sony and 99% of all other earbud manufactures figured out 15 years ago), and poor universally hated Y chord dangle.The only person EVER seen using these, was one person on an Apple TV commercial, everyone who got a ""free"" pair with their phone etc, have them trashed in the junk drawer at home. Apple, we love you, but 2 brain cells and 10 seconds of thought about earbud ergonomics and functionality, and yoyu never would have made these. Using them is as sad at drowning puppies.

2426,"I am reviewing a pair of these that came with an iPhone 5. They're nice and certainly an upgrade from what used to come with iPhones and iPods, but if I was going to spend money on a new set of earbuds I wouldn't buy these.The Fit (comfort and noise isolation):Certainly improved. The new design is more natural feeling in your ear and because the buds are not perfectly circular they do hug the contours of your ear a bit better and they do stay in somewhat better. They aren't totally secure (at least in my ear) and they provide little in the way of noise isolation. I know these aren't noise canceling and very few ear buds are, but the soft plastic earbuds offered by many manufacturers (Panasonic RPHJE120A In-Ear Headphone, Blue, JVC HAFX1X Headphone Xtreme-Xplosivs,Klipsch Image S4i Premium Noise-Isolating Headset with 3-Button Apple Control) at all price ranges do provide some degree of noise isolation and (again at least for my ears) hold much tighter than these do. I'm not saying these can't fit your ear perfectly, but even under the best circumstances they won't seal out sound.The Sound:Again the sound in these are much superior to those in the original earbuds, but not better than whats on the market. If you're serious about sound you may want to aim at a higher price product from klipsch (Klipsch Image S4i Premium Noise-Isolating Headset with 3-Button Apple Control) Ultimate Ears(Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10 Noise Isolating Earphones) or another high end brand. If you are more or less happy with the sound quality that you've gotten from your apple earbuds in the past then you're going to be happy with these and will even get a little boost in terms of clarity, bass, and decreased distortion. But if you're looking for roughly that level of sound quality you  don't need to spend $30. I'd check out the MEE M6 ear buds if you're looking for a slightly lower price and as good or better sound quality. (MEElectronics M6P-BK Sports Sound-Isolating In Ear Headphones with Microphone/Remote for iPod, iPhone and Smartphones (Black)). If you're looking for more of a bargain than that look at any of the sub $10 sets available on amazon.Call Clarity/mic remote:I admit I don't make a ton of calls. I have played around with making calls and using Siri through the microphone on these and it works well, but earbud remotes and mics aren't anything special anymore. This one doesn't do anything that the one on any set of earbuds with a 3 button mic can't do everything special about it is in the software in the iPhone so this isn't a feature you should pay more for just because its from apple. Additionally there are some really great bluetooth and wired call devices designed for making hands free calls if thats something you do a lot of. I don't know enough to comment on specific devices, but would look to a specialty product and not here if that was your priority.Overall Design: They're a good looking set of earbuds and do ""go"" with the iPhone and new devices. If thats important to you then by all means stop reading and buy this pair. You know what you're getting and its exactly what you want.Wrap upFine earbudsNothing SpecialAn improvement in sound and fit over old earbudsBut not a big enough improvement to justify the priceIf I was looking for a replacement (i.e. earbuds that I wasn't getting for free with another purchase) I wouldn't use/buy these3/5 stars",3.0,0,reviewing pair came iphone theyre nice certainly upgrade used come iphones ipods going spend money new set earbuds wouldnt buy thesethe fit comfort noise isolationcertainly improved new design natural feeling ear buds perfectly circular hug contours ear bit better stay somewhat better arent totally secure least ear provide little way noise isolation know arent noise canceling ear buds soft plastic earbuds offered many manufacturers panasonic inear headphone blue jvc headphone xtremexplosivsklipsch image premium noiseisolating headset apple control price ranges provide degree noise isolation least ears hold much tighter im saying cant fit ear perfectly even best circumstances wont seal soundthe soundagain sound much superior original earbuds better whats market youre serious sound may want aim higher price product klipsch klipsch image premium noiseisolating headset apple control ultimate earsultimate ears triplefi noise isolating earphones another high end brand less happy sound quality youve gotten apple earbuds past youre going happy even get little boost terms clarity bass decreased distortion youre looking roughly level sound quality dont need spend id check mee ear buds youre looking slightly lower price good better sound quality meelectronics sports soundisolating ear headphones microphoneremote ipod iphone smartphones black youre looking bargain look sub sets available amazoncall claritymic remotei admit dont make ton calls played around making calls using siri microphone works well earbud remotes mics arent anything special anymore one doesnt anything one set earbuds button mic cant everything special software iphone isnt feature pay apple additionally really great bluetooth wired call devices designed making hands free calls thats something lot dont know enough comment specific devices would look specialty product priorityoverall design theyre good looking set earbuds go iphone new devices thats important means stop reading buy pair know youre getting exactly wantwrap upfine earbudsnothing specialan improvement sound fit old earbudsbut big enough improvement justify priceif looking replacement ie earbuds wasnt getting free another purchase wouldnt usebuy stars

2447,"The average American now carries at least one electronic device on them at all times. The device can range from a cell phone to an mp3 player. In recent years, people have been able to enjoy both the aspects of a cellular device and an mp3 music player with the new smartphones that are being developed. They allow phones to contain fun and useful applications, music, and be able to make both regular and video calls. With this new technology, simple headphones or headsets are not able to keep up with everyday demands. Smartphone owners looking for a pair of reliable, high-quality headphones should consider buying Apple's earpods with remote and microphone despite the accessory being made mainly for Apple devices.The earpods excel in their functionality when used with Apple products. They are designed to work with Siri without having to go directly on your iPhone or iPad by using the remote function. This allows for a more hands free experience when using the Siri feature on the Apple devices. For example, by simply holding down the main button on the remote, you can access Siri. With the microphone feature added, you can answer or make calls in the same matter and it enables you to be able to use your hands for other things. The microphone can also be used during video calls on all of the other Apple devices that have the feature. Since it's difficult to reach my phone while I'm on the go, the microphone and remote functions are incredibly useful whenever I'm riding my bike or cruising on my skateboard. Even though the earpods were designed to be used specifically by Apple products, they are still compatible with other phones such as Androids and Blackberries.The compatibility with other devices that weren't from Apple was a surprise to me when I first used them. I had Evo 4G android phone and was only planning on using the earpods as temporary headphones. I was able to use the microphone to talk to others while doing playing videos and doing chores which is great since I'm a multitasker. The remote functions also worked great with the android phone. The only thing I couldn't do with the earpods was of course using Siri because androids don't have that function. To utilize the earpods' full potential, you have to use them on Apple devices. However, the quality of the earpods is the same on any device.The earpod's great audio quality allows its user to fully enjoy what they are listening to. For instance, the earpods design allows the bass of the audio, whether it be music or a movie one is watching, to be enhanced and sound crystal clear. They best function with rap, hip hop, dubstep, and dance music because the bass in the genres are a big part of the music. I prefer to listen to other types of music, but the audio is still fantastic. The quality of the audio when talking over the phone is also quite nice. Unlike other headphones, the earpods are designed to project the sound directly into your ears without being forced deep into them. It adds extra comfort while enjoying your favorite music.There is a downside to great quality headphones such as the Apple earpods. The cost of the earpods can range between $25 and $35, depending on where you buy them. Many people know that Apple tends to sell their products and accessories at ridiculously high prices, and that there are quite a few generic versions of their products. Despite the generic versions being the cheaper option, it is not worth the bargain. The generic versions are not water resistant and are more easily broken due to the cheaper material used to make them. There is a reason why the Apple earpods are the price they are. They last much longer than the cheaper kind and also produce a better quality of sound.The Apple earpods with the remote and microphone functions are a great accessory to have for anyone with a smartphone or portable device. The remote control and microphone features are easy to use and allow a simple hands free experience. The quality of the audio with added comfort from the design enhance your entertainment experience. Although they are quite expensive, the earpods are well worth the cost, and can be used on multiple devices, not just Apple products. Overall, if you are in the market for new high-quality and reliable headphones, Apple's earpods are the best choice out there.",5.0,1,average american carries least one electronic device times device range cell phone player recent years people able enjoy aspects cellular device music player new smartphones developed allow phones contain fun useful applications music able make regular video calls new technology simple headphones headsets able keep everyday demands smartphone owners looking pair reliable highquality headphones consider buying apples earpods remote microphone despite accessory made mainly apple devicesthe earpods excel functionality used apple products designed work siri without go directly iphone ipad using remote function allows hands free experience using siri feature apple devices example simply holding main button remote access siri microphone feature added answer make calls matter enables able use hands things microphone also used video calls apple devices feature since difficult reach phone im go microphone remote functions incredibly useful whenever im riding bike cruising skateboard even though earpods designed used specifically apple products still compatible phones androids blackberriesthe compatibility devices werent apple surprise first used evo android phone planning using earpods temporary headphones able use microphone talk others playing videos chores great since im multitasker remote functions also worked great android phone thing couldnt earpods course using siri androids dont function utilize earpods full potential use apple devices however quality earpods devicethe earpods great audio quality allows user fully enjoy listening instance earpods design allows bass audio whether music movie one watching enhanced sound crystal clear best function rap hip hop dubstep dance music bass genres big part music prefer listen types music audio still fantastic quality audio talking phone also quite nice unlike headphones earpods designed project sound directly ears without forced deep adds extra comfort enjoying favorite musicthere downside great quality headphones apple earpods cost earpods range depending buy many people know apple tends sell products accessories ridiculously high prices quite generic versions products despite generic versions cheaper option worth bargain generic versions water resistant easily broken due cheaper material used make reason apple earpods price last much longer cheaper kind also produce better quality soundthe apple earpods remote microphone functions great accessory anyone smartphone portable device remote control microphone features easy use allow simple hands free experience quality audio added comfort design enhance entertainment experience although quite expensive earpods well worth cost used multiple devices apple products overall market new highquality reliable headphones apples earpods best choice

2469,"A great improvement on Apple's EarBuds, the EarPods fit way more comfortably into my ears and have a louder, clearer sound quality than their predecessors. The main thing that I disliked about Apple's previous generation of in-ear earbuds was the great discomfort that they caused after extended use. After a few hours of use, the EarBuds would chafe and redden my ears. These new EarPods do not hurt my ears at all, even after prolonged use - I'm talking hours here. They also don't have that rubbery plastic around the circumference of the speaker and the the bottom of the stem that always wears off of the EarBuds. The sound quality of these EarPods is also miles beyond that of the EarBuds. I attribute this mostly to the way they are designed; with the speakers oriented further into your ear, the sound is louder. But the quality of the sound is also noticeably better. The bass is stronger and the mids are much clearer. These EarPods are a little on the expensive side for in-ear headphones, but they look great and do have the additional in-line remote for iPhone users and newer iPods. Overall, if you're thinking about upgrading from EarBuds, you won't be disappointed.",5.0,1,great improvement apples earbuds earpods fit way comfortably ears louder clearer sound quality predecessors main thing disliked apples previous generation inear earbuds great discomfort caused extended use hours use earbuds would chafe redden ears new earpods hurt ears even prolonged use im talking hours also dont rubbery plastic around circumference speaker bottom stem always wears earbuds sound quality earpods also miles beyond earbuds attribute mostly way designed speakers oriented ear sound louder quality sound also noticeably better bass stronger mids much clearer earpods little expensive side inear headphones look great additional inline remote iphone users newer ipods overall youre thinking upgrading earbuds wont disappointed

2473,"These came with my iPhone 5s that I bought about two months ago. I didn't really use them that much because I had already spent good money on a higher priced headset. I only used these earbuds at home on the couch when using over-the-head headphones would be uncomfortable. And then i figured I should stop bringing my headphones to school, so I began using my apple earbuds.I haven't used them for more than a week or two and the cord ripped, exposing wires. Sound still works and everything, but now they look trashy. Now I have read reviews and this seems to not be a problem with many people... So maybe it was a faulty pair.So ignoring that completely, let's go on to the review:If you currently own the old earbuds from Apple, then these are worth the upgrade. You will notice a huge difference in sound quality. I'm no audiophile, but I love good sounding headphones.The remote is the most convenient feature for me. I use these between classes at school, so I can't pull out my phone with everyone around me. It's a great feature.Speaking of school, one thing you probably know about Middle School, is that it is extremely loud in halls. These headphones won't cover up all that sound, but you can't expect a $30 pair to do that. Plus, if someone talks to you, you probably would want to hear them. Honestly I like how it doesn't cover everything. I like how I can hear music and everybody around me without having to leave 1 ear open (this only works at lower 1/4 levels.)Overall, if you own an Apple device, I'd say get these. They are worth it!If you don't own an Apple device, I believe the remote won't work, therefore I wouldn't spend the money on it.",4.0,1,came iphone bought two months ago didnt really use much already spent good money higher priced headset used earbuds home couch using overthehead headphones would uncomfortable figured stop bringing headphones school began using apple earbudsi havent used week two cord ripped exposing wires sound still works everything look trashy read reviews seems problem many people maybe faulty pairso ignoring completely lets go reviewif currently old earbuds apple worth upgrade notice huge difference sound quality im audiophile love good sounding headphonesthe remote convenient feature use classes school cant pull phone everyone around great featurespeaking school one thing probably know middle school extremely loud halls headphones wont cover sound cant expect pair plus someone talks probably would want hear honestly like doesnt cover everything like hear music everybody around without leave ear open works lower levelsoverall apple device id say get worth itif dont apple device believe remote wont work therefore wouldnt spend money
